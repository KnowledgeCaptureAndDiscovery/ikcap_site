DOCKER is an intelligent interface to enable unsophisticated users to
       configure and compose components as Web services with
       semantic markup.  Web services is a useful paradigm to
       encapsulate components including information sites on the Web,
       complex software, and simple conversion routines.
     </short>

<long>
We are developing intelligent interfaces and tools that enable
	naive users to:
	<ul>
<li> find relevant components for their purposes</li>
<li> create customized configurations of the components</li>
<li> compose components together to create more complex, customized, 
and capable ones</li>
</ul>
We are developing this system
	as a <i>Pathway Assembly Tool</i>
     to compose complex simulations for earthquake research in the 
context of the
     SCEC/IT project.
     Our approach is also applicable to assemble agents to do complex tasks,
     as in our

work.

<p>
We are developing DOCKER (Distributed Operations of Code with
Knowledge-based descriptions for Earthquake Research), a framework that
ensures adequate use of earthquake simulation models and code through
the use of a knowledge-based constraint reasoner.  Although our research
is motivated and driven by the analysis of seismic hazard, DOCKER is 
a domain-independent,
Web-based tool that can be used for other applications as well.
</p>

<p>
DOCKER supports the publication and use of implemented simulation models
through the following new capabilities:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>System ensures appropriate use of models.</i> Each simulation model
designed to take into account specific types of earth shaking phenomena,
which result in constraints that should be taken into account by the
engineers using the models. Seismic hazard analysis models are a good 
example of this,
where users must take into account 1) the type of tectonic region that
the model is applicable to, 2) the type of faulting, 3) magnitude range,
4) distance range, and 5) site types.  By representing these constraints
in a declarative and expressive language, the system can exploit
state-of-the-art knowledge representation and reasoning techniques to
detect violations of these constraints and to guide users in finding
models that are appropriate to the particular site and earthquake
forecast being considered.</li>

<li><i>Users have just-in-time access to documentation of models in order to
make judgments about the appropriate use of models.</i> Engineers that have
read the documentation months or years earlier may not necessarily
recall all the details that the model authors specified.  Backing up the
constraints with the appropriate documentation sources will be very
useful, especially when users need to make judgments about the severity
and possible dismissal of constraint violations.  In addition, it would
be useful to accommodate constraints in different degrees of
formalization.  Some of these constraints, such as the basic types and
bounds of input parameters, lend themselves more to formalization.
Other characteristics seem more appropriate for human consumption
"recordings with unknown or poor estimates of magnitude mechanism
distance or site excluded from data set", so that the user can put the
data into perspective.</li>

<li><i>New models are easily incorporated into the framework.</i>  Our
environment should facilitate the publication and use of new models in
order to accelerate scientific progress.  In particular in seismic hazard
analysis, new
models and updates of existing models are likely to appear in the near
and long term.  Publishing models should be a painless process and
should not require technical expertise in distributed computing or
knowledge representation skills.</li>
</ol>


<p>
Our initial implementation of DOCKER to publish and use simulation models
(embodied in executable code)
that includes the following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Integrates formal and informal representations of software components
and their associated constraints</b>: Constraints associated with the model
can be captured with different degrees of formality, and are always
grounded in documentation. When possible, models and their constraints
are formally represented and the system maintains a reference to
original documents that explain the constraint and that can be brought
up to the user's attention so the user can assess the severity of a
constraint violation.  This is also useful since there are important
constraints that require an involved and detailed effort in knowledge
representation that may not yet be expressible with the existing
ontologies and need to await further ontology development.</li>

<li> <b>Enforces adequate use of components through knowledge-based constraint
reasoning</b>: DOCKER is integrated with Powerloom, a knowledge
representation and reasoning system that provides an expressive language
to describe model constraints.  This enables the system to detect
constraint violations and alert users when any models or code are
invoked in an inappropriate context. With this framework, the system can
also be proactive and support users in case of constraint violations by
making suggestions about alternative settings that would respect those
constraints.  It also suggests the use of models that were not being
considered by the user.</li>

<li> <b>Supports access to models as layered services</b>: DOCKER supports
distributed access to models and code through a layered view of
service-based interaction, where a software component is viewed as a
service provider.  It is designed to facilitate future integration with
Grid services through the Open Grid Services Architecture (OSGA). DOCKER
provides a higher layer of abstraction by providing a knowledge-based
view of the capabilities of the services.</li>

<li> <b>Facilitates model publication</b>: DOCKER includes a user interface that
facilitates publication of code by guiding users through simple steps
that setup the system to automatically generate wrappers for the code
that enable it to function at the various service layers.  DOCKER also
generates automatically the user interface required to access and invoke
the models, as well as the necessary constraint checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
DOCKER's user interface is supported by any Web-based browser.  A User
Interaction Manager routes user requests to the appropriate internal
components.  A Constraint Reasoner accesses a Powerloom server to load
the formal descriptions of the models and to check constraints against
the overall SCEC ontologies.  For each model, a Publisher creates
automatically several layers of wrappers for the code provided by the
user. The lowest layers support message transport, and for this DOCKER
generates the corresponding WSDL description and SOAP handlers. At
higher layers, DOCKER generates automatically declarative expressions of
simple constraints (type, enumerations, and bounds) in Poweloom, as well
as XML Schemas for compatibility with lower layers. More complex
constraints can be added manually by knowledge engineers.
</p>

<p>
DOCKER uses
the IKRAFT Annotator [Gil and Ratnakar 02] to enable model publishers to link
constraints and any other salient statement about their model in free text
to the original documentation of the model (e.g., a technical publication).
This enables end users to see the reasons behind each constraint in 
the model and
understand whether it is ok to override certain constraints if necessary.
</p>

<p>
Our plans for future work include better support to handle constraint
violations, support for ontology development to capture relevant
domain terminology, integration with the Grid
infrastructure being developed within the SCEC/IT work, and
incorporation of physics-based (Pathway 2) models into our framework.
