<b>Trellis</b> is an interactive web-based application for argumentation and decision-making. Using Trellis, uses can come to individual and collaborative conclusions on virtually any topic, from scientific discourse to political and policy views to deciding which product to purcase or select the place to stay on a vacation.

<!-- something about arriving at this bottom-up -->
<!-- diagram of the decision process -->

     <p>The key innovative ideas behind our approach are:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     Supporting users to create knowledge "snippets" (microcontent) from the original sources
     as well as from other microcontent. The key is to capture how the user 
     progressively generates new knowledge that results in added value to the
     original raw information sources. Our goal is to support users to
     highlight key salient information from large reports and documents, to
     add new knowledge fragments based on their analysis and integration of
     existing information, and to finally create semi-formal fragments.</li>

     <li>
     Capturing and exploiting interrelations between contributor-generated public semantic annotation of information. As part of their analysis, 
     users are given the opportunity to annotate raw information sources with 
     knowledge about the source's quality and relevance to given topics.
     The users are also encouraged to enter their analysis in a form which facilitates retireval of relevant additional analyses, microcontent, and web sources.  The tool provides <i>incremental payoff</i> to the user -- the more the user annotates and helps the system understand the analysis, the more help the system can render.</li>

     <li>
     Extensible semantic markup of information items and their relationships.
     Users will be able to draw from a core semantic markup language that will
     contain a basic domain-independent vocabulary to formulate annotations.
     They will also be able to extend this core language with additional terminology
     useful in their particular domain. Using this language, users will
     be able to annotate not only the information items themselves, but they
     will also be able to annotate the relationships among them, which will
     enable them to qualify and describe interdependencies between different
     information sources and how they relate to a new conclusion or assessment
     added by the developer. In essence, links between the information
     items will be first class citizens in the knowledge base.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Below is a diagram of the current <b>Trellis</b> architecture. A
     User typically starts searching the Web for a certain document, or indicating
     a pointer to a specific Web resource that contains useful information.
     Each is considered an information item. Information items may include
     raw information sources (an image, a text document, a video, etc.) as well
     as products of previous analysis (by the user or by other users.)
     All the information items are in some sense the knowledge base that <b>Trellis</b>
     operates on, and we refer to it as the Semantically Marked Information
     Base, or SMIB. We refer to an information item as an EI2 (Extended
     Information Items).</p>

     <center>
	  <img src="arch.jpg"/>
	  </center>

     <p>Users extend the SMIB using two tools: the Annotation Tool and the Creation
     Tool. They can use the EI2 Annotation Tool to add semantic annotations
     to an EI2 to describe its contents and to relate them to other EI2.
     For example, an EI2 may be annotated as containing a map, or an interesting
     event. The Annotation tool can also be used to relate EI2.
     The tool will provide an editor with a set of connectors. An example
     is a connector to denote that two EI2s are contradictory. This way,
     the user may link an EI2 that contains a description of a product as having
     a tag price of $20 to another EI2 that has the same product with
     a price of $25.</p>
     <p>The Annotation tool draws on a library of semantic annotations and connectors
     that will be based on a core domain-independent language defined by the
     Semantic Annotation Vocabulary. An Interdependency Schema defines
     a vocabulary for connectors based on a variety of dimensions: pertinence,
     reliability, credibility, structural (x is example of y, x is part of y,
     x describes y, etc.) causality (x1 x2...xn contribute to y, x1 x2...xn
     indicate y, etc.) temporal ordering (x before y, x after y, x simultaneous
     with y, etc.), argumentation (x may be reason for y, x supports y, etc.).
     The Domain Schema contains a core vocabulary to annotate the content of
     documents that extends the Interdependency Schema with domain terms.
     Our plan is that <b>Trellis</b> will provide a core vocabulary, and users will
     be able to extend it with additional terms.</p>
     <p>The Creation Tool enables users to create new EI2. For example,
     a user may create an EI2 as an assessment that he or she formulates based
     on existing EI2. If a combination of some subparts of EI2 lets a
     user conclude or decide on some definition, then the subparts can be captured
     into a new Information Item, that drops all other irrelevant parts of the
     original EI2. A new EI2 can be added by extracting or summarizing
     some of the previous results.</p>
     <p>Below is a snapshot of the current user interface of <b>Trellis</b>.
     In this case, a user is using <b>Trellis</b> to decide whether a mission to take
     Navy SEALs to Athens is feasible. Given the Web sources consulted
     and the indicated capabilities of the SEAL team (shown on the left), the
     user has entered the rationale for deciding that the operation is not feasible.</p>

	  </center>

     <p/><p>We plan to extend <b>Trellis</b> with learning and adaptive techniques
     in order to offer to the user improved and extended capabilities over time.
     As users annotate more EI2 and create new EI2 that capture their analysis,
     <b>Trellis</b> will be able to exploit this information and become increasingly
     more proactive. We also plan to add a Query Facility that will allow
     users to search the SMIB based on the semantic annotations of the EI2.
     It will include a structured editor to guide users to formulate queries
     using the semantic annotation vocabulary defined in the schemas.</p>
     <p>In summary, <b>Trellis</b> provides users with tools that enable them to specify
     information in increasingly more structured form, and to specify semantic
     annotations that can be exploited for processing and integration of separate
     information items.</p><br/>
