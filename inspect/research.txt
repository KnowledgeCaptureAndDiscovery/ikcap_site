<P>INSPECT is being extended in several important dimensions under the DARPA
JFACC program. Some of these extensions require basic R&D work on the EXPECT
framework on generating explanations and justifications for INSPECT's
recommendations, and on Web-based tools to support domain experts to change
INSPECT's knowledge base. Other extensions will widen the scope of INSPECT's
evaluations to do the following:
<oL>
<li>Include additional types of objectives (such as force
support (logistics) and force enhancement (ISR - intelligence, Surveillance
and reconaissance).
<li>Evaluate the plan from a more global
perspective that would include information about strategy and plan rationale.
