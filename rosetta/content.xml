  <title>Ontology-Based Agent Communication</title>
  <description>
    <short>
    <n/> is is a prototype message translation system that supports communication between
    heterogeneous agents using ontology merging technology and exploiting ontologies developed
    under the HPKB program to address inter-agent communication issues of central relevance to CoABS.

    <n/> supports communication between heterogeneous agents using
    ontology merging technology that exploits several ontologies that have been
    developed and used in the HPKB program. As a testbed we will apply Rosetta to
    support communication of goals and plans of heterogeneous planning agents.
    his work will be driven by the needs of the CoABS TIEs involving planning
    agents as well as lessons that we and others have learned from integrating
    planning agents in several ARPI TIEs (e.g., TIE 97-1, TIE 97-2). We view
    Rosetta as a service that can be incorporated into existing multi-agent
    architectures to extend their communication capabilities
