<B>ROSETTA</B> supports communication between heterogeneous agents using
ontology merging technology that exploits several ontologies that have been
developed and used in the HPKB program. As a testbed we will apply Rosetta to
support communication of goals and plans of heterogeneous planning agents.
his work will be driven by the needs of the CoABS TIEs involving planning
agents as well as lessons that we and others have learned from integrating
planning agents in several ARPI TIEs (e.g., TIE 97-1, TIE 97-2). We view
Rosetta as a service that can be incorporated into existing multi-agent
architectures to extend their communication capabilities
