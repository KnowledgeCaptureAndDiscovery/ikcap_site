  <title>SHAKEN Action Description Language</title>

  <status>
   Work begin in January 2001, with the first version completed in
   February 2001. Work is ongoing in migrating SADL to the various
   components of SHAKEN and in enhancements needed to support more
   complex process representations in RKF Year 2, and to support simulation.

    <short>
     SADL is the action description language used by the various parts
     of the SHAKEN knowledge acquisition system, to represent
     processes. It is designed to be small and simple, yet expressive
     enough to represent processes from the molecular biology domain in SHAKEN.
