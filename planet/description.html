      <p /> As we develop larger and more complex intelligent systems
      in knowledge-intensive domains, it becomes impractical to
      develop knowledge bases from scratch. Recent research
      investigates how to develop intelligent systems by drawing from
      libraries of reusable components that include both ontologies
      and problem-solving methods. Planet is a reusable ontology for
      representing plans that is designed to accomodate a diverse
      range of real-world plans, both manually and automatically
      created. We have drawn from our past experience in designing,
      developing and integrating planning tools, and expect planet to
      ease these tasks in the future in three ways. First, we have
      already found it useful for knowledge modelling. By providing a
      structure that formalizes useful distinctions for reasoning
      about states and actions, a knowledge engineer can find the
      semantics of informal expressions of plans (e.g., textual or
      domain-specific) through designing mappings to the
      ontology. Second, a plan ontology can be a central vehicle for
      knowledge reuse across planning applications. Planet contains
      general, domain-independent definitions that are common and
      useful across planning domains. Third, Planet can facilitate
      integration of planning tools through knowledge sharing.

      <p /> Currently, practical efforts to integrate planning tools
      are done by designing separate interchange formats for (almost)
      each pair of tools, since designing a more universal format is
      costly and often more difficult than designing the entire set of
      pairwise formats. These difficulties are in part because these
      systems include decision-support tools such as plan editors,
      plan evaluation tools, and plan critiquers, which represent
      plans in ways that are different from traditional AI plan
      generation systems. Planet can provide a shared plan
      representation for systems to communicate and exhange
      information about the plan, and can facilitate the creation of a
      common, overarching knowledge base for future integrations of
      planning tools.

      <p /> Planet is available in Loom, KIF, and CycL. Send email to
      Jim Blythe (blythe@isi.edu) or Yolanda Gil (gil@isi.edu) if you
      would be interested in seeing the latest version.
