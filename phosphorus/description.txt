<H2>Description</H2>
<P>    	   	 
<B>PHOSPHORUS</B> is a knowledge-based matcher that accepts a user's
description of a needed service as input and responds with a ranked list of
agents that have the capability to provide that service. The Phosphorus matcher
is both knowledge based and experience based. It accesses a base of ontological
knowledge to assist the process of performing structural matches between pairs
of requested and advertised capabilities, and it takes a knowledge-based
approach to guide a post-match decision process that determines how retrieved
capabilities can be selected, reformulated, and/or combined to best satisfy a
user request. We assume that exact matches will be relatively rare; our
matcher exploits domain ontologies to allow loose-coupling between agent
capabilities and user requests, finding agents that have more specific
capabilities than what was requested, or agents that can provide a related
service when no exact matches are found. Loose coupling is enabled by
using EXPECT's goal and capability language to describe agent capabilities and
requests are then be matched through subsumption, goal reformulation,
and partial match. The matcher is also experienced-based, using learning
techniques to improve the utility of its matches over time.
<P><B>PHOSPHORUS</B>
is able to abstract the results of its learning, storing its experience in the
form of axioms in a knowledge base that summarize its knowledge of matching
requests with agents within a particular domain. Phosphorus can be used
standalone or be used as a service within existing agent integration
architectures.
