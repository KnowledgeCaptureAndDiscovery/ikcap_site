<h3>Initial domain description</h3>

<p>Warning: the UI shown here is a little out of date. These demo
screenshots are from December 2004.</p>

<p>Tailor's initial screen, below, shows how a top-level goal will be
carried out in SPARK using an interactive tree widget to allow the user
to see the domain as an overview or in detail. This description is
automatically generated from the SPARK procedure representation,
optionally using templates to specify an English phrase for a predicate
or action.
</p>

<h3>Modifying the domain description</h3>

<p>This domain is based on a page in <a href="http://www.ehow.com"
target="new">EHow.com</a> that describes how to hang drywall from a
ceiling. Users can post tips on the pages there, which we use as
third-party examples of modifications to process descriptions. In this
case, a user posted a tip that that drywall jack doesn't help much and
it is easier to hold the drywall directly onto the ceiling. The Tailor
user paraphrases this modification for Tailor as <em>"Don't use a
drywall jack if you are a drywall expert"</em>. Tailor attempts to
recognize this sentence as a modification to its process description,
and provides feedback about the modification it thinks the user might be
making, as shown below.

<h3>Noticing potentially unintended side effects and suggesting
remedies</h3>

<p>In the new process description shown above, step 6 has been colored
red, and a button labelled 'Warning' appears next to it. When the user
clicks the button, Tailor explains what it thinks might be a problem
with this new description.</p>

<p>The step that has been made conditional on not being an expert has an
effect: it places the sheet on the drywall jack. The step in question
has been defined so it will be an error if it is applied when the sheet
is not on the drywall jack. Tailor can't know for sure that this won't
be true when step 6 is applied because other actions could cause it to
change, but it highlights that the condition will no longer be
established by step 3 and offers the user some ways to fix it, that have
been specialized from general knowledge about fixes to SPARK
domains.</p>

<p>The user wants to apply the condition to both steps 3 and 6. This can
be achieved by explicitly selecting the steps in separate window that
appears when the user clicks on 'select expression'.</p>

<center><img src="demo/screen4.gif"/></center>

<p>Once this is done, the new proposed change to the process description
is shown as in the screen below. The user can select 'send' to have this
new definition sent to the SPARK process, which can use it while it is
running.</p>
