<center><h1>2016 SUMMER INTERNS of the <br/><a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/">Interactive Knowledge Capture Group</a></h1></center>
<div class="project_post_content">

<p>Four students interns joined the Interactive Knowledge Capture group this summer:  Sizhuo Zou, a graduate student in the USC Annenberg School of Communications; Alyssa Deng, a recent graduate at Troy High School on her way to Carnegie Mellon University; Catherine Wang, a raising senior at Troy High School; and Jason Jewik, a 9th grader at Whitney High School</a>

Next to them is Yolanda Gil, Director of Knowledge Technologies and Research Professor at USC and their advisor during the internships</div></div>

<p>Sizhuo Zou designed and built a web site to organize teaching materials about data science.  The materials are from a course on data science for non-programmers that she took as a student when Dr. Gil taught it at USC in the Spring.  

<p>Alyssa Deng was an intern the year before, when she worked on developing materials for training non-programmers on data science.  This year, she learned about ontologies and how they are used to describe objects in the world and their properties.  She developed a new ontology of musical instruments, artists, and groups.  She also created a homework unit based on that ontology.  She also wrote a tutorial on concepts on ontologies.

<p>Catherine Wang worked on a project on argumentation. She did a literature survey of existing tools, and compared their capabilities using examples based on her experience with high-school debate.  

<p>Jason Jewik worked on generating data visualizations and integrating them with workflows.  His work on visualizations will help improve understanding of data analysis processes and products.

<p>Student interns from all over the world join the AI group at ISI every Summer.  For more information, please contact gil@isi.edu.
