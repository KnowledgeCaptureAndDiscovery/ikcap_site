EXPECT is an environment for developing knowledge-based systems that
includes knowledge acquisition tools to extend and modify knowledge
bases. Research topics include knowledge-acquisition, knowledge
modeling, description and composition of problem solving knowledge,
ontology development and use in a problem-solving context,
and distributed web-based problem solving. We
have used EXPECT to develop several applications
including air campaign planning, workarounds for
target damage, transportation planning,
and course of action analysis.
<br/>
EXPECT is being used in the <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/constable/">Constable</a> interface.

The research focus of EXPECT is the development of
     <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap">
acquisition interfaces</a>
that help users to extend the knowledge of intelligent systems
     and their knowledge bases.
     Much of our work has been on <a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap">planning</a>
tasks and applications, including process models.
     A recent area is <a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap">grounding knowledge bases
     in the Semantic Web</a> to enable problem solving in 
heterogeneous distributed
     environments, including projects such as <a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/docker">
     DOCKER</a>,
     <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/trellis">TRELLIS</a>,
     and
     <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/">Pegasus</a>.

<p>
<b>Main Research Themes</b>
</p>
Our work concentrates on several research themes nad are motivated by
     a number of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap">user studies</a>
that we have conducted:
        <ul>
        <li> How do users know they are doing the right thing?
             When a system understands how each individual piece of 
knowledge relates to others
             then it can figure out how new knowledge fits, and can 
figure out how to interact
             with the user when new knowledge is inconsistent or when 
other necessary knowledge
             is missing.  Our approach is to build acquisition 
interfaces that can
             automatically derive Interdependency Models from a 
knowledge base and use them to
             guide the acquisition dialogue.
             We used this approach in
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/emed">EMeD (EXPECT's 
Method Editor)</a>,
             and in the
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/kanal">KANAL</a> tools 
for analyzing
             process models.
             </li>

<li> <b>How can we help users handle the formal representations that 
our systems use?</b>
Building on past research on natural language generation, we have developed an
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/english-editor">English-based 
editor</a> that allows
             users to select meaningful strings of a paraphrase and 
search the knowledge
             base for sensible alternative replacements.
             </li>

<li> <b>How can we help users make complex modifications to a knowledge
             base that require many related small changes?</b>
We have developed dialogue planning tools that represent
             typical sequences of changes that users make and use them to
             dynamically generate follow-up questions to users.
             We used this approach in
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/ka-scripts">KA Scripts</a>,
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/constable">PSMTool/Constable</a>, and
             our new work on
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/slick">acquisition 
dialog planning</a>.
             </li>
<li> <b>How can we help users figure out where to start?</b>
Because it is hard for users to start entering knowledge
             from scratch, we assume that the system has some
             general background knowledge that the user populates
             with domain-specific information.
             We have built several declarative domain theories for this
             purpose, including
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/planet">PLANET (a PLAn 
semantic NET)</a>.
             </li> <li> <b>How can a user turn informal and possibly 
disconnected information
             into increasingly more formalized and operational knowledge?</b>
             </li>
</ul>

Our work concentrates on several research themes:
     <ul>
<li> When users are not AI experts, what kinds of help do they need to
     teach new knowledge to an intelligent system?
     We have conducted a number of <a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap">user studies</a>
and some of the central problems we found are:
        <ul> <li> <b>How can we help users handle the formal 
representations that our systems use?</b>
Building on past research on natural language generation, we have developed an
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/english-editor">English-based

             base for sensible alternative replacements.
     </li>

             When a system understands how each individual piece of

             then it can figure out how new knowledge fits, and can 
figure out how to interact

interfaces that can
             automatically derive Interdependency Models from a 
knowledge base and use them to
             guide the acquisition dialogue.
             We used this approach in
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/expect">EXPECT</a>,
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/emed">EMeD (EXPECT's

     </li>
<li> <b>How can a user turn informal and possibly disconnected information
             into increasingly more formalized and operational knowledge?</b>
A new research area is on tools to develop
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap">
Resilient Hyper Knowledge Bases (RHKBs)</a>,
		which capture the rationale and development of knowledge
                 bases from the original sources of information used.
		These tools will guide users step by step to
		create increasingly more formal representations of knowledge.
		We are using some natural language processing techniques
		to help users enter knowledge from textual sources.
