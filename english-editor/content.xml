  <title>Editing problem-solving knowledge using a structured English paraphrase, navigation and expression composition</title>

  <status>

   <short>
   Work on the english editor begain in 1998 under the HPKB program. Versions
   have been delivered under both HPKB and the Active Templates
   programs. It can be run using Java on windows or unix-based systems.

   <p /> The english editor has been delivered as part of Constable, as
   well as under earlier projects, and can be run under windows or other
   operating systems using Java 1.3 or higher. A user guide that covers
   the english editor can be found on <a
   href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/constable/status.html">the Constable
   page</a>.

   <p /> Work on the English editor began in 1998 and is ongoing. The
   editor is implemented in Java and integrated with the main Expect
   interface. It was used in experiments conducted at Fort Leavenworth
   in 1998 under HPKB and in several subsequent experiments under both
   HPKB and the Active Templates programs. The current focus is on the
   expression composer, which suggests alternatives to sentence
   fragments based on search terms.

      The English editor allows the user to examine and modify
      problem-solving knowledge through an automatically-generated
      English paraphrase of that knowledge. When users select parts of
      the paraphrase to modify, the editor suggests replacements, also
      paraphrased. The editor can also compose expressions based on
      search terms from the user.

     <p />Users often face a barrier in specifying problem-solving
     knowledge for use in an intelligent system because they are not
     familiar with available constructs in the language used by the
     system for problem-solving knowledge, or with the syntax of that
     language. The English method editor provides an interface for
     users to examine and modify problem-solving knowledge through an
     English paraphrase that is automatically generated from the
     executable specification of the knowledge in Expect. The English
     text has a structure that corresponds to the structure of the
     problem-solving knowledge, so that users can select parts of the
     paraphrase that correspond to sub-expressions in the
     specification. When a sub-expression is selected, the editor
     generates alternative expressions that the sub-expression could
     be changed to, and presents them to the user in English
     paraphrase. In this way the editor helps a user with both the
     available constructs and the syntax in the underlying
     language.

     <p /> For more details on an older version of the paraphrase and
     alternatives generators used in the English method editor, see <a

     Blythe and Ramachandran KAW-99</a>.

     <p />The editor includes an Expression Composer that
     generates compound syntactic expressions based on search terms
     and provides them as suggestions for the user. This is designed
     to help users begin with imprecise terms and choose from
     alternatives to find an appropriate yet precise and syntactically
     correct term. For examples and more details see <a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/expression-composer.html">these
     slides</a>.

     <p />The editor makes use of other components of Expect's
     integrated UI to allow users to modify knowledge about instances,
     concepts and relations in concert with modifying problem-solving
     knowledge. At the same time the editor is able to help the user
     more by having the larger context of the integrated UI. See <a
