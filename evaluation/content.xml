  <name>Evaluation</name>
  <title>A problem-solving method library for plan evaluation</title>

  <description>
    <short>
      We are developing a reusable knowledge base of general
      principles for plan evaluation and critiquing.

      As intelligent systems become larger and work in increasingly
      more complex and knowledge intensive environments, it becomes
      impractical to develop knowledge bases from scratch. A practical
      alternative is to develop knowledge bases out of reusable
      components, either ontologies or domain-independent problem
      solving methods. We are developing a reusable knowledge base of
      general principles about plan evaluation and critiquing. It
      includes ontologies to represent plans and critiques, an
      ontology of <a
      href="http://www.isi.edu/isd/HPKB/output-ontology">evaluation
      criteria</a>, and problem-solving knowledge about how to
      evaluate plans with respect to those criteria. Currently, the
      evaluation criteria analyze various aspects of the plan
      structure and its use of resources. We performed a study of
      three evaluation and critiquing task domains, and found that our
      framework covers 96 percent of the critiquing criteria related
      to plan structure and resource use. Our framework also enables a
      systematic approach to the development of plan evaluation tools
      by following the organization of the criteria in the method.

      <p />The evaluation PSM is used in our work on <a
