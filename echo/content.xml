This project started in 2004.

The main ECHO functions are implemented and tested with simple
visitor hosting episodes.

ECHO (mEta-Cognitive History analysis and Organization) is a memory-based
meta-level reasoning tool for interactive knowledge capture. 
It estimates the confidence level of learned knowledge using past problem
solving episodes and provides suggestions to improve the knowledge and make
the problem solving more successful. 
     </short>

<long>

The goal of this work is to develop knowledge capture interfaces that can
reason about the status of the knowledge being developed and provide
assistance in building better knowledge that makes the overall problem solving
more successful over time.  In order to support this, the system maintains a
memory model that relates each knowledge to the problem solving episodes it
matched, the episodes where it was actualy used, and the episodes it can
potentially contribute to.  This model is used in assessing user entered
knowledge, checking if it can be confidently used, it conflicts with some
successful results and needs some modifications, or it needs significant
changes including deactivation.  Based on this assessment, Echo guides the
user in improving and maintaining the confidence levels of the knowledge over
time.

Memory-Based Meta-Level Reasoning for Interactive Knowledge Capture,
Evaluating Status of Learned Knowledge using Past Problem Solving Episodes.
</short>
<long>

In existing knowledge capture systems, knowledge entered by the user (called
k-items) are treated equally and systems do not reflect on how each knowledge
has been built and how well it has been used over time.  The systems cannot
provide effective assistance in making the k-items more useful and the
resulting problem solving more successful.  We present an an extension to
knowledge acquisition interfaces that 1) keeps track of past problem solving
episodes and relates them to each k-item 2) assesses the current status of
k-items and problem solving using such relations and 3) provides assistance to
improve k-items based on the assessment.
<p>
Echo builds a memory model that relates each
k-item to the problem solving episode it was built from, the episodes it
matched, the episodes where it was actually used, and the episodes it can
potentially contribute to.  This model is used in assessing a k-item, checking
if it can be confidently used, it conflicts with some successful results and
needs some modifications, or it needs significant changes including
deactivation.  Based on this assessment, Echo guides the user in improving and
maintaining the confidence levels of the k-items over time. The following
shows the architecture of the system.

<p>


The following algorithms show how memory model changes through knowledge
authoring (add new k-item, modify a k-item, and deactivate/delete a k-item)
and problem solving.  They also show how Echo makes use of the memory model in
providing assistance to the user. These algorithms are general and independent
of a given application or the knowledge representation used.
