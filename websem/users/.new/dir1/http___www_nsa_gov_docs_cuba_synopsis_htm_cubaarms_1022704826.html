              <P>The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was one of the
                turning points of the Cold War between the United States and the
                Soviet Union. At that time the two superpowers came close to
                war, possibly with nuclear weapons; after it, both countries
                began to seek ways to adjust to each other, in particular, to
                prevent the use of nuclear weapons.</P>
              
              <P>The events of the Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrated the
                maturity of the U.S. intelligence community, especially in its
                ability to collect and analyze information. The crucial roles of
                human intelligence (HUMINT) and photographic intelligence
                (PHOTINT) in the Cuban Missile Crisis have been known from the
                beginning. Documents declassified and released in 1998 now
                reveal that signals intelligence (SIGINT) also played an
                exceedingly important part in managing the crisis.</P>
              
              <P>It should be said at the outset that signals intelligence did
                not provide any direct information about the Soviet introduction
                of offensive ballistic missiles into Cuba. However, in the more
                than two years before that fact was known, SIGINT analysts
                thoroughly studied the Cuban military buildup. Once the
                offensive missiles were discovered, SIGINT provided direct
                support for day-to-day management of the crisis. This is the
                story of SIGINT in the Cuban Missile Crisis.</P>
              
              <P>When Fidel Castro took power in Cuba by overthrowing the
                previous dictator, Fulgencio Batista, he was hailed as a
                liberator by the Cuban people themselves and became a hero to
                the American people as well. However, Castro soon took actions
                inimical to American interests and aligned his country publicly
                with the Soviet Union. The U.S. public and government were
                gravely concerned about the creation of a communist state and
                member of the Soviet Bloc only seventy miles from its southern
                shores; this problem became a major focus of the new Kennedy
                administration when it took office in January 1961.</P>
              
              <P>In response to the potential threat and the administration's
                interest in it, the U.S. intelligence community began a new
                focus on information about Cuba. The National Security Agency
                also beefed up its coverage of Cuba and Soviet support for the
                island nation.</P>
              
              <P>In Havana, one of the consequences of its alignment with the
                USSR was fear that the United States might intervene against the
                new Cuban government. This fear materialized in later 1961 when
                Cuban exiles, trained by America's CIA, staged an invasion of
                Cuban territory at the Bay of Pigs. Although the invasion was
                quickly repulsed, it intensified an arms buildup that was
                already under way.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD>

              <P>The signing of agreements with the Soviet Union and
                Czechoslovakia in mid-1960 was followed by a secret arms buildup
                in Cuba sponsored by the Soviets and their satellites. Early
                indications of that buildup came from signals intelligence --
                the exploitation of Soviet and Soviet Bloc communications that
                carried information related to the arms supply operations.
                Beginning late in 1960 and extending through 1961, NSA
                intercepted messages concerning Soviet ships headed for Havana.
                The cargo manifests were suspiciously blank, indicating that
                what they carried was more than just palm oil or farm equipment.</P>
              
              <P>For example, early in 1961 the Nikolay Burdenko arrived at the
                Cuban port of Mariel. The unloading operation was highly secret,
                but NSA caught Cubans discussing the arrival of tanks. It was
                hardly an innocent delivery.</P>
              
              <P>As vessels poured forth their cargoes, the Cubans took extra
                precautions to keep them secret. They kept gawkers away from the
                wharf, unloaded at night, even prohibited overflights of the
                area while the unloading was taking place. Deliveries rolled
                away from the pier under black canvas and heavy guard. The
                United States government knew this from NSA intercepts of Cubans
                discussing the procedures.</P> <IMG SRC="http___www_nsa_gov_docs_cuba_synopsis_htm_cubaarms_1022704826_items/http___www_nsa_gov_docs_cuba_images_czecflag.gif" ALT="Czech" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3">
              
              <P><A NAME="czech"></A>The agreement with the Czech government
                in June of 1960 resulted in additional deliveries of small arms
                and ammunition, light aircraft, military vehicles, and equipment
                for military factories. Even more ominous was the training of
                Cuban pilots in Czechoslovakia. American intercept operators
                began to hear Spanish along with the usual mix of Slavic tongues
                coming from airfields in Czechoslovakia. As early as the fall of
                1960, Cuban pilots were being trained in piston-engine trainers;
                later evidence showed that the training included jet aircraft.
                Thus it came as no surprise when, in mid-1961, CIA sources got
                wind of the imminent arrival of Soviet combat and transport
                aircraft, including the light bomber IL-28 and the state of the
                art MIG-15s, 17s and 19s. It was clear by then that a major
                upgrade of the Cuban air forces was in progress.</P>
              
              <P>One problem shared by intelligence analysts and administration
                policymakers alike was the nature of the military deliveries.
                Most of the military equipment could be described accurately as
                defensive, but much of it could also be used in taking the
                offense. The primary questions for Americans was: would the
                Soviets introduce offensive missiles into Cuban territory?</P>
              
              <P>Improvements to Cuban defensive capabilities continued to
                characterize Soviet deliveries. In May of 1961 NSA discovered
                references to shipborne radar, and, in June, radars associated
                with antiaircraft guns. Cubans chattered over the radio about &quot;highly
                unusual aircraft&quot; and impending training on various
                unspecified &quot;Russian equipment.&quot;</P>
              
              <P>Military deliveries increased in 1962, and along with them,
                Soviet attempts to conceal them. An NSA report in July indicated
                that Soviet vessels calling on Cuban ports were making false
                port declarations and declaring less than the known cargo
                carrying capacity. By late August NSA noted that there had
                already been fifty-seven voyages in a little over a month, and
                some ships were on their second voyage in that period of time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD>

              <P><A NAME="radar"></A>Cuban air defenses improved at an
                accelerating pace. In May, SIGINT reports had the first
                indication of airborne fire control radar on MIG-17and MIG-19
                planes. Ground radar activity became heavier all over the
                island. By early summer, NSA analysts concluded that the Cubans
                were putting together an air defense system copied from the
                Soviet model. Equipment, training, and procedures were the same.
                In fact, by early fall NSA was listening to Russian ground
                controllers speaking in heavily accented Spanish to Cuban
                pilots.</P>
              
              <P>Confronted with American concerns about this military buildup,
                several Soviet spokesmen, including the foreign minister,
                assured the U.S. government that the military equipment sent to
                Cuba was for defense only. Offensive weapons would not be
                introduced.</P>
              
              <P>In August and September 1962, Soviet deliveries surged to the
                highest levels ever seen. In August, CIA analysts saw the first
                indications of an ominous new development, the construction of
                SA-2 surface-to-air missiles. These represented a new turn in
                the arming of Cuba -- such weapons could shoot American military
                aircraft out of the skies, including CIA's U-2 photographic
                reconnaissance planes. It had been an SA-2 that had shot down
                Francis Gary Powers's U-2 over the Soviet Union two years
                earlier.</P>
              
              <P>SA-2s, moreover, were very expensive. Was the Soviet purpose
                to keep U.S. reconnaissance aircraft out of Cuba, and if so,
                why? John McCone, Director of Central Intelligence, came up with
                an answer that no one wanted to hear -- that SA-2s were on the
                island to deny the United States the capability to see the
                construction of offensive missile installations. Others in the
                defense and intelligence communities dissented from this
                opinion.</P>
              
              <P>Human sources and photography could spot SA-2s, but signals
                intelligence would provide the first indicator of their
                operational status. On September 15, NSA reported the first
                operation of a Spoon Rest radar, associated with the SA-2. The
                SA-2 was operational, and could shoot down a U-2. Subsequent
                overflights would be at risk.</P>
              
              <P>Other parts of the Cuban air defense system also matured in
                September. NSA reported that Cuban pilots, previously trained in
                Soviet Bloc countries, frequently went up to challenge American
                aircraft buzzing the periphery of the island. Cuban pilots
                practiced timed scrambles, and performed border patrols whenever
                American naval aircraft approached. Under the watchful eye of
                Russian GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) controllers, their
                procedures became coordinated and efficient. With the new MIG
                fighters, using Soviet-originated ground control procedures and
                Soviet weapons, Cuban pilots were becoming a potent defensive
                force. With the antiaircraft weapons and surface-to-air
                missiles, American aircraft would approach Cuba at their peril.</P>

              <P><A NAME="u2"></A>On October 10, NSA reported that the Cuban
                air defense system seemed to be complete. They had just begun
                passing radar tracking from radar stations to higher
                headquarters and to defensive fighter bases using Soviet
                procedures. Their system, with Russians in advisory positions at
                every point, was ready for business. It was into this defensive
                thicket that a CIA U-2 flew four days later. Although it 
                survived, on October 25 another U-2 was shot down.</P>

              <P><A NAME="missile"></A>At this point, on October 15 analysis
                of photographs taken on the U-2 flights revealed to the U.S.
                senior leadership that the Soviet Union was preparing sites to
                install SS-4s, medium-range ballistic missiles. DCI McCone,
                alone among the government's senior leaders, had been correct
                about Soviet intentions. President John F. Kennedy secretly
                convened a series of emergency meetings of his senior military, 
                diplomatic, and political advisors, a grouping that became known
                as the Executive Committee, or ExCom, to seek ways of coping
                with this ominous development.</P>
              
              <P>As the crisis progressed, and the ExCom considered a wide
                variety of diplomatic and military options, the need for
                information on Cuba and the Soviet Union increased. All members
                of the U.S. intelligence community responded splendidly.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD>

              <P>At NSA, the response to the crisis was led by the director,
                Lieutenant General Gordon Blake, USAF. Blake had become DIRNSA
                only three months before, but he had a strong background in
                communications and intelligence. Early in his career he had been
                operations officer at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, and was
                awarded the Silver Star for gallantry during the Japanese attack
                on December 7, 1941. After a series of command and staff
                positions, in 1957 he became chief of the Air Force Security
                Service. Two years later he became vice commander and chief of
                staff of the Pacific Air Forces, then chief of the Continental
                Air Command. In 1962, when Vice Admiral Laurence Frost was
                unexpectedly transferred from his position as DIRNSA, Gordon
                Blake was selected as his replacement.</P>
              
              <P>Much of the day-to-day -- or minute-to-minute -- burden fell
                on an element of the Operations organization headed by Mrs.
                Juanita Moody. Mrs. Moody had begun her career as a cryptanalyst
                during World War II and had remained in cryptology after the end
                of the war. Her office worked around the clock to reexamine
                older reports about the status of Cuba's armed forces and
                produce current intelligence quickly. In addition to producing
                new reports and summaries, Mrs. Moody found it necessary to give
                impromptu telephone briefings to senior military and political
                decision makers, most of whom would call for information updates
                at any hour of the day or night.</P>
              
              <P>Mrs. Moody later recalled how NSA responded as a team to the
                crisis, sometimes in unusual ways. At one point General Blake
                came to her office to ask if he might be of any assistance to
                the effort there. She asked him to try to get additional staff
                to meet a sudden need for more personnel. Shortly she heard him
                on the telephone talking to off-duty employees: &quot;This is
                Gordon Blake calling for Mrs. Moody. Could you come in to work
                now?&quot;</P>
              
              <P>To ensure timely responses to unexpected needs by the
                consumers of SIGINT, General Blake established NSA's first
                around-the-clock command center. General Blake also took
                responsibility for getting NSA's product to the White House and
                interpreting its sometimes arcane indicators to the
                policymakers.</P>
              
              <P>NSA had deployed a considerable capability around Cuba,
                including SIGINT collection from ground-based stations, and
                aircraft circling the periphery of the island, just outside
                Cuban territorial waters. The USS Oxford, a specially configured
                SIGINT collection ship, nestled close to the Cuban coastline
                intercepting radio communications from the island.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD>

              <P>On October 22, President Kennedy appeared on television and
                announced the U-2 findings to an anxious public. Despite
                assurances from the Soviet government that the buildup was
                defensive in nature, he said, medium-range and
                intermediate-range ballistic missiles had been introduced into
                Cuba. He called for their withdrawal or elimination. As one
                measure to solve the crisis, he proclaimed a naval &quot;quarantine&quot;
                of Cuban ports to prevent the introduction of additional Soviet
                armaments. Kennedy also warned that further actions might be
                needed if the buildup of offensive weapons continued.</P>
              
              <P>SIGINT collectors listened to the radio messages to and from
                the Soviet vessels on their way to Cuba. Would they turn around,
                or would they challenge the U.S. Navy &quot;quarantine&quot;
                that the president had imposed on Cuba? A cordon of U.S. Navy
                vessels awaited the Soviet cargo vessels in the Atlantic.
                Conflict between them, if it happened, carried with it the
                possibility of escalation into a wider war between the two
                superpowers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD>

              <P>The answer came the next day, from signals intelligence. A
                Navy SIGINT direction finding net in the Atlantic located the
                Soviet ships by intercepting and triangulating messages that
                they were sending back to the Soviet Union. The ships were
                stopped dead in the water, outside the ring of American naval
                vessels waiting for them. A confrontation had been averted, one
                that might have precipitated war. The president, his cabinet,
                and the American people could breathe a little easier.</P>

              <P><A NAME="dove"></A>Later, once the Soviets agreed to remove

                SIGINT, combined with other types of intelligence such as
                photography and human sources, had pinpointed Cuba as a grave
                threat to the United States. The arms buildup and the defensive
                improvements spelled trouble, and focused the president and
                military leaders on the threat from Cuba long before the crisis
                erupted. In the middle of crisis, the intelligence system gave
                the president the information he needed to extricate the nation
                from its most dire crisis since the end of World War II.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
