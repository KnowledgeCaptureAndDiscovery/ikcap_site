<div style="font-size:10px">Searching for Gravitational Waves in Pulsars
and Other Stellar Objects</div>

<p>Gravitational waves, though predicted by Einstein's theory of
relativity, have never been observed experimentally.  Through
simulations of Einstein's equations, scientists predict that those waves
should be produced by colliding black holes or collapsing
supernovae.</p>
<p>The Laser Interferometry Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)
project aims to detect such phenomena.  At $300M, it is the largest
single enterprise ever undertaking by National Science Foundation.  With
facilities in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington, LIGO joined
gravitational-wave observatories in Italy, Germany and Japan in
searching for these signals.  Pulsars are believed to generate such
waves, so scientists search areas with known pulsars as well as other
areas in the hope that they will find other objects that emit them as
well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> planner that we have
developed is one of the tools that scientists can use to analyze data
collected by LIGO.  In the Fall of 2002, a 17-day data collection effort
was held, followed by a two-months run in February of 2003 and a
six-month run that will start in late 2003.  LIGO instruments are
designed to measure the effect of gravitational waves on test masses
suspended in a vacuum.  The data collected during experiments is a
collection of time series (multi-channel). The observations are
processed through Fourier transforms and frequency range extraction
software. This may involve composing a workflow of hundreds of jobs and
executing them in appropriate computing resources on the grid, which
gets unmanageable very fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> was used with LIGO data
collected during the first scientific run of the instrument, which
targeted a set of locations of known pulsars as well as random locations
in the sky.  <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> generated
end-to-end grid job workflows that were run over computing and storage
resources at Caltech, University of Southern California, University of
Wisconsin Milwaukee, University of Florida, and NCSA.</p>
<p>The screenshot and movie above show a visualization of the results of
a pulsar search.  The search ranges are specified by scientists on the
lower left corner of the screen.  The top left corner shows the specific
range displayed in this visualization.  The bright points represent the
locations searched.  The red points are pulsars within the bounds
specified for the search, the yellow ones are pulsars outside of those
bounds.  Blue and green points are the random points searched, within
and outside the bounds respectively.</p>
