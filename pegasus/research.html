Cognitive grids are a collaboration
between Grid and AI researchers at ISI aimed to
provide intelligent middleware for Grid computing infrastructure.
Our initial work has been exploratory and driven by the 
<a href="http://www.griphyn.org">
GriPhyN</a>
and the
<a href="../scec-it">
SCEC/IT</a> projects.
</p>

<p>
One of the challenges for scientists is to configure complex workflows
of components and to setup the complex scripts required to execute each
component (e.g., FFT code) as a job on a specific grid resource (e.g., a
linux cluster).  One of the applications within the GriPhyN project is
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), where
instruments collect data that needs to be analyzed in order to detect
gravitational waves predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity.  One
of the tasks involved is pulsar searches in certain areas of the sky for
a time period, where observations are processed through Fourier
transforms and frequency range extraction software.  This may involve
composing a workflow of hundreds of jobs and executing them in
appropriate computing resources on the grid, which gets unmanageable
very fast. In addition, you have to spend a lot of time to become a
knowledgeable grid user in order to do this, even if you have simple job
workflows to run.  Physicists may be happy to do this (though they would
probably prefer not to), but other potential users of scientific
software may not be.  Last but not least, using the grid is not free and
means sharing resources with others, so intelligent middleware can make
grids more efficient and accessible overall.
</p>

<p>
Our approach to these problems is to use automated planning techniques
combined with knowledge representation and reasoning to specify the
capabilities and requirements of these components as well as the
capabilities offered by computing and storage resources available on the
grid.  We are developing <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu"> Pegasus</a>
(Planning for Execution in Grids), a configurable system that can
generate and execute complex workflows on the Grid.  Pegasus includes an
AI planner that uses information about the capabilities and requirements
of each domain-specific component (e.g., FFT code or simulation code) in
terms of meta-data requirements and results (e.g., a seismic hazard
simulation takes a fault model as input) as well as resource
requirements.  Pegasus uses the Metadata Catalog Service (MCS), newly
developed at ISI, to perform the mapping between application-specific
attributes and logical file names of existing data products. AI-based
planning technologies are used to construct an end-to-end workflow,
taking into account preferences and other heuristics to minimize
execution time or data movement.  Pegasus also contains a Virtual Data
Language generator that can populate the Chimera catalog with newly
constructed derivations. Finally, Pegasus generates the necessary submit
files and sends the Workflow to the grid's DAGMan for execution.  We
have used Pegasus for LIGO pulsar search, using LDAS and compute and
storage resources at Caltech, University of Southern California,
University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, University of Florida, and NCSA.
This application was demonstrated at the Supercomputing Conference
(SC-2002).
</p>

<p>
Our future plans include incorporating these techniques in the new
service-based grid architecture proposed by OGSA (Open Grid Services
Architecture), dynamic planning and scheduling techniques for robust
execution of job workflows, and using the grid as a robust
infrastructure for distributed heterogeneous agent communities.
Our work on Pegasus forms part of our work on the 
<a href="../cognitive-grids">Cognitive Grids</a>
project, along with work on interactive workflow construction and 
ontologies for resource match-making.
