   We are working on several research thrusts:
 <ul>
 <li> <a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/kanal/project-main-view.xml">KANAL (building/checking various process models)</a>: We have built a tool for building and checking process models.  By
relating different pieces of information in process models among themselves
and to the existing KB, it performs a variety of verification and validation
checks and propose useful fixes.  Our initial evaluation of KANAL a stand-alone system shows its usefulness
in finding errors and suggesting fixes.  It also has been
successfully integrated within an end-to-end system that support users
entering domain knowledge
  </li>
  <li><a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/dialog-manager/project-main-view.xml">Dialog Manager (keeping track of user
actions and making suggestions)</a>: We are developing a dialogue manager that uses KA plans to keep 
track of the user's actions and can make suggestions for how to 
proceed.  The dialogue manager would support: 1) generation, to 
suggest to the user what to do next based on the library of KA plans, 
2) recognition, to track what the user is doing in terms of the KA 
plans.  The dialogue state would be shown to the user as a "status" 
window, where the user could see the currently active KA plans as a 
list of bullets and sub-bullets, each bullet would be checked if 
completed and collapsed when all its sub-bullets are completed. 
 </li>
 <li><a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/english-editor/project-main-view.xml">Expression Composer (helping users to express their knowledge
without worrying about KR language)</a>: The English editor allows the user to examine and modify
      problem-solving knowledge through an automatically-generated
      English paraphrase of that knowledge. When users select parts of
      the paraphrase to modify, the editor suggests replacements, also
      paraphrased. The editor can also compose expressions based on
      search terms from the user.
 </li>
 <li> <a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/sadl/project-main-view.xml">Developing
action language</a>: We have developed the SHAKEN action language, for representing processes with loops,
   partially ordered events and conditional and disjunctive events in KM.
 </li>
 </ul>
