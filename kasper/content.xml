It has been successfully integrated within an end-to-end system (SHAKEN),
which has been used by biologists to enter
textbook knowledge about molecular biology.

<li> <b>KANAL</b>: 
<p />We performed an initial evaluation of <a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/kanal/project-main-view.xml">KANAL (a
tool for helping users build/check process models)</a> in December 2000, which has been reported in
<a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/KANAL/kanal-ijcai01.pdf">Kim and
Gil, IJCAI-01</a>.  The results show that KANAL can find most of the errors in
the process models and suggest useful fixes including the fixes that directly
point to the sources of the errors.

<p /> KANAL has been successfully integrated within the end-to-end system
(<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~rkf/">SHAKEN</a>) that supports subject
matter experts entering domain knowledge.  During summer 2001, the SHAKEN system has been evaluated by lightly
trained biologists where they author biology textbook knowledge using the
system.  The resulting knowledge bases answer questions that a student might
be asked based on the chapter's contents.

 <li> <b>Dialog Manager</b>: <a

 <li> <b>Expression Composer</b>: <a

 <li><b>SADL</b>: Its <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/action-language.html">design</a> is reported in Feb 2001. Currently, KANAL can
support most of the functions.

    We are participating in the DARPA <a
href="http://reliant.teknowledge.com/RKF/">Rapid Knowledge Formation (RKF)</a>
program where the goal is to enable distributed teams of subject matter
    experts (SMEs) to enter and modify knowledge directly and easily, without
training in knowledge representation, acquisition, or manipulation. 

As a part of the program, we are working on several research thrusts.
 <ul>
 <li> <a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/kanal/project-main-view.xml">KANAL (building/checking process models)</a>: We have built a tool for building and checking process models.  By
relating different pieces of information in process models among themselves
and to the existing KB, it performs a variety of verification and validation
checks and propose useful fixes.  Our initial evaluation of KANAL a stand-alone system shows its usefulness
in finding errors and suggesting fixes.  It also has been
successfully integrated within an end-to-end system that support users
entering domain knowledge
  </li>
  <li><a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/dialog-manager/project-main-view.xml">Dialog Manager (keeping track of user
actions and making suggestions)</a>: We are developing a dialogue manager that uses KA plans to keep 
track of the user's actions and can make suggestions for how to 
proceed.  The dialogue manager would support: 1) generation, to 
suggest to the user what to do next based on the library of KA plans, 
2) recognition, to track what the user is doing in terms of the KA 
plans.  The dialogue state would be shown to the user as a "status" 
window, where the user could see the currently active KA plans as a 
list of bullets and sub-bullets, each bullet would be checked if 
completed and collapsed when all its sub-bullets are completed. 
 </li>
 <li><a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/english-editor/project-main-view.xml">Expression Composer (helping users to express their knowledge
without worrying about the underlying representation language)</a>: The English editor allows the user to examine and modify
      problem-solving knowledge through an automatically-generated
      English paraphrase of that knowledge. When users select parts of
      the paraphrase to modify, the editor suggests replacements, also
      paraphrased. The editor can also compose expressions based on
      search terms from the user.
 </li>
 <li> <a
     href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/sadl/project-main-view.xml">SADL
(a language to describe process models)</a>: We have developed the SHAKEN action language, for representing processes with loops,
   partially ordered events and conditional and disjunctive events in KM.
 </li>
 </ul>

KANAL has been successfully integrated within an end-to-end system (
<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~rkf/">SHAKEN</a>) and other two are being developed as modules within the next version of
the system.
