    <abstract>Incremental utility elicitation (IUE) is a
    decision-theoretic framework in which tools simultaneously make
    suggestions to a human decision maker based on an incomplete
    model of the decision maker's utility function, and update the
    model based on feedback from the user. Most systems that
    perform IUE construct and ask questions about a small number of
    alternatives in order to build a model of the user's
    preferences. We describe a system called VEIL that is based on
    visual exploration of the available alternatives and provides
    visual cues about their estimated utility based on IUE. VEIL
    uses a linear programming formulation to make fast updates to
    the utility estimate based on the user's expressed preferences
    between pairs of alternatives. In experiments, VEIL's update
    method converges quickly to make good suggestions and help the
    user form an overall impression of the space of
    alternatives.</abstract>

    <abstract>The operation of a human organization requires dozens
    of everyday tasks to ensure coherence in organizational
    activities, to monitor the status of such activities, to gather
    information relevant to the organization, to keep everyone in
    the organization informed, etc. Teams of software agents can
    aid humans in accomplishing these tasks, facilitating the
    organization's coherent functioning and rapid response to
    crises, while reducing the burden on humans. Based on this
    vision, this paper reports on Electric Elves, a system that has
    been operational, 24/7, at our research institute since June 1,
    2000. Tied to individual user workstations, fax machines,
    voice, mobile devices such as cell phones and palm pilots,
    Electric Elves has assisted us in routine tasks, such as
    rescheduling meetings, selecting presenters for research
    meetings, tracking people's locations, organizing lunch
    meetings, etc. We discuss the underlying AI technologies that
    led to the success of Electric Elves, including technologies
    devoted to agent-human interactions, agent coordination,
    accessing multiple heterogeneous information sources, dynamic
    assignment of organizational tasks, and deriving information
    about organization members. We also report the results of
    deploying Electric Elves in our own research
    organization.</abstract>

    <abstract>The area of knowledge acquisition research concerned
    with the development of knowledge acquisition (KA) tools is in
    need of a methodological approach to evaluation. Efforts such
    as the Sisyphus experiments have been useful to illustrate
    particular approaches, but have not served in practice as
    testbeds for comparing and evaluating different alternative
    approaches. This paper describes our experimental methodology
    to conduct studies and experiments of users modifying knowledge
    bases with KA tools. We also report the lessons learned from
    several experiments that we have performed. Our hope is that it
    will help others design or improve future user evaluations of
    KA tools. We found that performing these experiments is
    particularly hard because of difficulties in controlling
    factors that are unrelated to the particular claims being
    tested. We discuss our ideas for improving our current
    methodology and some open issues that remain.</abstract>

    <abstract>Role-limiting approaches using explicit theories of
    problem-solving have been successful for acquiring knowledge
    from domain experts. However most systems using this approach
    do not support acquiring procedural knowledge, only instance
    and type information. Approaches using interdependencies among
    different pieces of knowledge have been successful for
    acquiring procedural knowledge, but these approaches usually do
    not provide all the support that domain experts require. We
    show how the two approaches can be combined in such a way that
    each benefits from information provided by the other. We extend
    the role-limiting approach with a knowledge acquisition tool
    that dynamically generates questions for the user based on the
    problem solving method. This allows a more flexible interaction
    pattern. When users add knowledge, this tool generates
    expectations for the procedural knowledge that is to be added.
    When these procedures are refined, new expectations are created
    from interdependency models that in turn refine the information
    used by the system. The implemented KA tool provides broader
    support than previously implemented systems. Preliminary
    evaluations in a travel planning domain show that users who are
    not programmers can, with little training, specify executable
    procedural knowledge to customize an intelligent
    system.</abstract>

    <abstract>In order to support a wide range of planning-related
    activities, we argue that plan and action representations must
    move to a more expressive language for goals and capabilities
    than is found in most current systems. A structured
    representation for capabilities can make explicit a hierarchy
    of capabilities based on subsumption, resulting in benefits for
    reasoning, representing, and acquiring operators and plans. By
    making capabilities more easily understandable to humans, such
    a representation can also benefit mixed-initiative approaches.
    We present a structured representation of capabilities and a
    subsumption-based matcher for it. We then describe three
    existing systems that use this approach in different kinds of
    planning tasks and tools. We finish with a discussion of how
    plan generation systems can benefit from using this
    representation.</abstract>

    <abstract>As intelligent systems become larger and work in
    increasingly more complex and knowledge intensive environments,
    it becomes impractical to develop knowledge bases from scratch.
    A practical alternative is to develop knowledge bases out of
    reusable components, either ontologies or domain-independent
    problem solving methods. This paper describes a reusable
    knowledge base of general principles about plan evaluation and
    critiquing. It includes ontologies to represent plans and
    critiques, an ontology of evaluation criteria, and
    problem-solving knowledge about how to evaluate plans with
    respect to those criteria. Currently, the evaluation criteria
    analyze various aspects of the plan structure and its use of
    resources. We performed a study of three evaluation and
    critiquing task domains, and found that our framework covers
    approximately 75 percent of the critiquing criteria related to
    plan structure and resource use (and over 90 percent within the
    framework's declared scope). Our framework also enables a
    systematic approach to the development of plan evaluation tools
    by following the organization of the criteria in the
    method.</abstract>

    <abstract>Developing tools that allow non-programmers to enter
    knowledge has been an ongoing challenge for AI. In recent years
    researchers have investigated a variety of promising approaches
    to knowledge acquisition (KA), but they have often been driven
    by the needs of knowledge engineers rather than by end users.
    This paper reports on a series of experiments that we conducted
    in order to understand how far a particular KA tool that we are
    developing is from meeting the needs of end users, and to
    collect valuable feedback to motivate our future research. This
    KA tool, called EMeD, exploits Interdependency Models derived
    from a knowledge base in order to guide users in specifying
    problem-solving knowledge. One of the challenges of this work
    is to devise a methodology and experimental procedure for
    conducting user studies of knowledge acquisition tools. We
    describe how our experiments helped us address several
    questions and hypotheses regarding the acquisition of
    problem-solving knowledge from end users and the benefits of
    Interdependency Models, and discuss what we learned in terms of
    improving not only our KA tools but also about KA
    research.</abstract>

    <abstract>Ontologies are becoming a recognized vehicle for
    knowledge reuse, knowledge sharing, and modeling. This paper
    presents PLANET, an ontology for representing plans. To show
    that PLANET is a comprehensive ontology that can be reused to
    build new applications, we describe several specializations of
    it to represent plans in three different real-world domains
    that were made by adding minor extensions to PLANET's general
    definitions and classes. In past work, we have developed
    several plan evaluation systems in these domains, and have
    integrated them in several occasions with plan editors and plan
    generation systems. For each of these integrations, and often
    for each system in the integration, a new format for exchanging
    plans was devised. PLANET can represent all of the plans that
    we and others have used in these domains, providing a standard
    universal format for knowledge sharing that can be used as an
    interlingua in integrated planning applications. Finally, the
    paper discusses how we have used PLANET as a knowledge
    modelling tool to design representations for courses of action
    in a military domain, guiding us to make useful distinctions
    and modelling choices.</abstract>

    <abstract>Knowledge Acquisition (KA) Scripts capture typical
    modification sequences that users follow when they modify
    knowledge bases. KA tools can use these Scripts to guide users
    in making these modifications, ensuring that they follow all
    the ramifications of the change until it is completed. This
    paper describes our approach to design, develop, and organize a
    library of KA Scripts. We report the results of three different
    analysis to develop this library, including a detailed study of
    actual modification scenarios in two knowledge bases. In
    addition to identifying a good number of KA Scripts, we found a
    set of useful attributes to describe and organize the KA
    Scripts. These attributes allow us to analyze the size of the
    library and generate new KA Scripts in a systematic way. We
    have implemented a portion of this library and conducted two
    different studies to evaluate it. The result of this evaluation
    showed a 15 to 52 percent time savings in modifying knowledge
    bases and that the library included relevant and useful KA

    <abstract>Configuration systems often use large and complex
    knowledge bases that need to be maintained and extended over
    time. The explicit representation of problem-solving knowledge
    and factual knowledge can greatly enhance the role of a
    knowledge acquisition tool by deriving from the current
    knowledge base, the knowledge gaps that must be resolved. This
    paper details Expect's approach to knowledge acquisition in the
    configuration domain using the propose-and-revise strategy as
    an example. Expect supports users in a variety of KA tasks like
    filling knowledge roles, making modifications to the knowledge
    base including entering new components, classes and even
    adapting problem-solving strategies for new tasks. Expect's
    guidance changes as the knowledge base changes, providing a
    more flexible approach to knowledge acquisition. The paper also
    examines the possible use of Expect as a KA tool in the complex
    and real world domain of computer configuration.</abstract>

    <abstract>Successful approaches to developing knowledge
    acquisition tools use expectations of what the user has to add
    or may want to add, based on how new knowledge fits within a
    knowledge base that already exists. When a knowledge base is
    first created or undergoes significant extensions and changes,
    these tools cannot provide much support. This paper presents an
    approach to creating expectations when a new knowledge base is
    built, and describes a knowledge acquisition tool that we
    implemented using this approach that supports users in creating
    problem-solving knowledge. As the knowledge base grows, the
    knowledge acquisition tool derives more frequent and more
    reliable expectations that result from enforcing constraints in
    the knowledge representation system, looking for missing pieces
    of knowledge in the knowledge base, and working out
    incrementally the inter-dependencies among the different
    components of the knowledge base. Our preliminary evaluations
    show a thirty percent time savings during knowledge
    acquisition. Moreover, by providing tools to support the
    initial phases of knowledge base development, many mistakes are
    detected early on and even avoided altogether. We believe that
    our approach contributes to improving the quality of the
    knowledge acquisition process and of the resulting
    knowledge-based systems as well.</abstract>

    lies in the fact that the user need not understand the syntax
    of the expert system to make modifications. By analyzing the
    problem-solving knowledge, the tool can allow the user to
    select semantically coherent chunks of the knowledge. It then
    presents English paraphrases of possible substitutions that
    would result in new problem-solving knowledge that is
    syntactically correct. In this way the tool expands the range
    of modifications that a naive user can make to problem-solving

    particular approaches, but have not served in practice as
    testbeds for comparing and evaluating different alternative
    approaches. This paper describes our experimental methodology
    to conduct studies and experiments of users modifying knowledge
    bases with KA tools. We also report the lessons learned from
    several experiments that we have performed. Our hope is that it
    will help others design or improve future user evaluations of
    KA tools. We found that performing these experiments is
    particularly hard because of difficulties in controlling
    factors that are unrelated to the particular claims being
    tested. We discuss our ideas for improving our current
    methodology and some open issues that remain.</abstract>

    <abstract>The recent advances in computer speed and algorithms
    for probabilistic inference have led to a resurgence of work on
    planning under uncertainty. The aim is to design AI planners
    for environments where there may be incomplete or faulty
    information, where actions may not always have the same results
    and where there may be tradeoffs between the different possible
    outcomes of a plan. Addressing uncertainty in AI planning
    algorithms will greatly increase the range of potential
    applications but there is plenty of work to be done before we
    see practical decision-theoretic planning systems. This article
    outlines some of the challenges that need to be overcome and
    surveys some of the recent work in the area.</abstract>

    <abstract>Modifying knowledge-based systems (KBSs) is a complex
    activity. One of its difficulties is that several related
    portions of the KBS might have to be changed in order to
    maintain the coherence of the system. However, it is difficult
    for users to figure out what has to be changed and how. This
    paper presents a novel approach for building knowledge
    acquisition (KA) tools that overcomes some of the limitations
    of current approaches. In this approach, knowledge of
    prototypical procedures for modifying KBSs is used to guide
    users in changing all related portions of a KBS. These
    procedures, which we call knowledge acquisition scripts (or KA
    Scripts), capture how related portions of a KBS can be changed
    coordinately. By using KA scripts, a KA tool would be able to
    relate individual changes in different parts of a KBS, enabling
    the analysis of each individual change from the perspective of
    the overall modification. The paper also describes the
    implementation of ETM: a script-based tool that builds on the
    Expect framework for building KBSs (Gil, 1994), discusses how
    we have addressed some important issues of this approach, and
    describes a preliminary empirical evaluation of ETM that shows
    that KA Scripts allow users to perform KBSs modification tasks
    more efficiently.</abstract>

    <abstract>Our goal is to build knowledge acquisition tools that

    to building knowledge acquisition tools which capture knowledge
    about commonly occurring modification sequences and support
    users in completing the modifications they start. These
    sequences, which we call KA Scripts, relate individual changes
    and the effects that they have on the knowledge base. We
    discuss our experience in designing and compiling a library of
    KA Scripts. We also describe the implementation of a tool that

    <abstract>INSPECT is a mixed-initiative plan evaluation tool in
    the domain of air campaign planning that has been a central
    component of several major DARPA demonstrations of integrated
    planning environments and tools. The creation process of an air
    campaign plan is manually driven at its higher levels, and
    because plans are complex and always changing they often (our
    experience says always) contain errors or inconsistencies.
    INSPECT evaluates user-generated plans and alerts the user
    about inconsistencies and potential problems. INSPECT has
    received wide acceptance by air campaign planning experts, and
    is currently undergoing new extensions and further integrations
    with other tools in this domain. The paper describes our work
    on INSPECT, analyzes the key contributions of this tool, and
    draws some conclusions about the design and integration of
    planning applications.</abstract>

    <abstract>If we could share knowledge across systems, costs
    would be reduced. However, because knowledge bases are
    typically constructed from scratch, each with their own
    idiosyncratic structure, sharing is difficult. Recent research
    has focused on the use of ontologies to promote sharing. An
    ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for
    describing a domain that can be used as a skeletal foundation
    for a knowledge base. If two knowledge bases are built on a
    common ontology, knowledge can be more readily shared, since
    they share a common underlying structure. This paper outlines a
    set of desiderata for ontologies, and then describes how we
    have used a large-scale (50,000+ concept) ontology to develop a
    specialized, domain-specific ontology semi-automatically. We
    then discuss the relation between ontologies and the process of
    developing a system, arguing that to be useful, an ontology
    needs to be created as a "living document", whose development
    is tightly integrated with the system's. We conclude with a
    discussion of Web-based ontology tools we are developing to
    support this approach.</abstract>

    <abstract>Weaver is a hybrid planning algorithm that can create
    plans in domains that include uncertainty, modelled either as
    incomplete knowledge of the initial state of the world, of the
    effects of plan steps or of the possible external events. The
    plans are guaranteed to exceed some given threshold probability
    of success. Weaver creates a Bayesian network representation of
    a plan to evaluate it, in which links corresponding to
    sequences of events are computed with Markov models. As well as
    the probability of success, evaluation produces a set of flaws
    in the candidate plan, which are used by the planner to improve
    it. We describe a learning method that generates control
    knowledge compiled from this probabilistic evaluation of plans.
    The output of the learner is search control knowledge for the
    planning domain that helps the planner select alternatives that
    have previously lead to plans with high probability of success.
    The learned control knowledge is incrementally refined by a
    combined deductive and inductive mechanism.</abstract>

    <abstract>Role-limiting approaches support knowledge
    acquisition (KA) by centering knowledge base construction on
    common types of tasks or domain-independent problem-solving
    strategies. Within a particular problem-solving strategy,
    domain-dependent knowledge plays specific roles. A KA tool then
    helps a user to fill these roles. Although role-limiting
    approaches are useful for guiding KA, they are limited because
    they only support users in filling knowledge roles that have
    been built in by the designers of the KA system. Expect takes a
    different approach to KA by representing problem-solving
    knowledge explicitly, and deriving from the current knowledge
    base the knowledge gaps that must be resolved by the user
    during KA. This paper contrasts role-limiting approaches and
    Expect's approach, using the propose-and-revise strategy as an
    example. Expect not only supports users in filling knowledge
    roles, but also provides support in 1) adapting the
    problem-solving strategy, 2) changing the types of information
    to be acquired about a knowledge role, 3) adding new knowledge
    roles, and 4) acquiring additional background information about
    the domain needed by the knowledge-based system. Expect's
    guidance changes as the knowledge base changes, providing a
    more flexible approach to knowledge acquisition. This work
    provides evidence supporting the need for explicit
    representations in building knowledge-based systems.</abstract>

    is that it understands the structure of the knowledge-based

    <abstract>A system that acquires knowledge from a user should
    be able to reflect upon the knowledge that it has - at each
    moment - and understand what kinds of new knowledge it needs to
    learn. For the past two decades, research in the area of
    knowledge acquisition has been moving towards systems that have
    access to richer representations of knowledge about their task.
    This paper reviews some well-known knowledge acquisition tools
    representative of this trend. It also describes our recent work
    in Expect, a system with explicit representations of knowledge
    about the task and the domain that supports knowledge
    acquisition for a wider range of tasks and applications than
    its predecessors. We hope our observations will be useful to
    researchers in user interfaces and in machine learning
    concerned with acquiring information from users.</abstract>

    <abstract>Our goal is to build knowledge acquisition tools that
    support users in making a broad range of changes to a knowledge
    base, including both factual and problem-solving knowledge.
    These changes may require several individual modifications to
    various parts of the knowledge base, that need to be carefully
    coordinated to prevent users from introducing errors in the
    knowledge base. Thus, it becomes essential that our KA tools
    understand the consequences of each kind of change that the
    user may initiate, detect any harmful side-effects that can be
    introduced in the system, and guide the user in resolving them.
    To address this issue, we have developed a transaction-based
    approach to knowledge acquisition that can support users in
    making complex modifications to a knowledge base. A transaction
    is a sequence of changes that together modify some aspect of
    the behavior of a knowledge-based system, and that when only
    partially carried out may leave the knowledge base in an
    undesirable state. If a user executes a transaction partially,
    the knowledge acquisition tool must provide guidance to finish
    it and support the user in achieving the desired modification.
    This paper also describes our work in extending Expect's
    knowledge acquisition tool to support transaction-based
    mechanisms. Expect tracks the possible problems that arise as a
    consequence of each individual change to the knowledge base,
    keeps information about the context of each change, and uses
    this context to resolve the problems detected and to request
    the user's intervention if additional information is
    needed.</abstract>

    <abstract>To create more powerful knowledge acquisition
    systems, we not only need better acquisition tools, but we need
    to change the architecture of the knowledge based systems we
    create so that their structure will provide better support for
    acquisition. Current acquisition tools permit users to modify
    factual knowledge but they provide limited support for
    modifying problem solving knowledge. In this paper, we argue
    that this limitation (and others) stem from the use of
    incomplete models of problem solving knowledge and inflexible
    specification of the interdependencies between problem solving
    and factual knowledge. We describe the Expect architecture
    which addresses these problems by providing an explicit
    representation for problem solving knowledge and intent. Using
    this more explicit representation, Expect can automatically
    derive the interdependencies between problem solving and
    factual knowledge. By deriving these interdependencies from the
    structure of the system itself Expect supports more flexible
    and powerful knowledge acquisition.</abstract>

    <abstract>It is hard to evaluate in current planning
    applications what aspects of the approach address each of the
    complexities of the problem. This results from the fact that
    the planning community is lacking a vocabulary to describe
    planning tasks and applications. This work is an effort towards
    descriptions of planning applications in terms that are useful
    1) to extract conclusions from particular implementations, 2)
    to facilitate cross-comparisons among different planners
    applied to the same problem, and 3) to facilitate comparisons
    among different tasks. We analyze the Sisyphus experience, a
    3-year old and still ongoing effort in the knowledge
    acquisition community to enable a cross-comparison of their
    application systems as they implement a common pre-stated
    problem description. Based on this experience, we propose a set
    of dimensions to describe applications that distinghish between
    descriptions of the properties of the architecture, the type of
    problem, and the data sets. We show how they can be used to
    produce useful distictions in the context of the first Sisyphus
    task, which was an office assignment problem. Our hope is that
    the same dimensions will be useful to other researchers in
    describing and characterizing their applications, as well as a
    useful point of comparison for future Sisyphus
    efforts.</abstract>

    <abstract>A knowledge acquisition tool should provide a user
    with maximum guidance in extending and debugging a knowledge
    base, by preventing inconsistencies and knowledge gaps that may
    arise inadvertently. Most current acquisition tools are not
    very flexible in that they are built for a predetermined
    inference structure or problem-solving mechanism, and the
    guidance they provide is specific to that inference structure
    and hard-coded by their designer. This paper focuses on Expect,
    a reflective architecture that supports knowledge acquisition
    based on an explicit analysis of the structure of a
    knowledge-based system, rather than on a fixed set of
    acquisition guidelines. Expect's problem solver is tightly
    integrated with LOOM, a state-of-the-art knowledge
    representation system. Domain facts and goals are represented
    declaratively, and the problem solver keeps records of their
    functionality within the task domain. When the user corrects
    the system's knowledge, Expect tracks any possible implications
    of this change in the overall system and cooperates with the
    user to correct any potential problems that may arise. The key
    to the flexibility of this knowledge acquisition tool is that
    it adapts its guidance as the knowledge bases evolve in
    response to changes introduced by the user.</abstract>

    <abstract>Rapid prototyping and tool reusability have pushed
    knowledge acquisition research to investigate method-specific
    knowledge acquisition tools appropriate for predetermined
    problem-solving methods. We believe that method-dependent
    knowledge acquisition is not the only approach. The aim of our
    research is to develop powerful yet versatile machine learning
    mechanisms that can be incorporated into general-purpose but
    practical knowledge acquisition tools. This paper shows through
    examples the practical advantages of this approach. In
    particular, we illustrate how existing knowledge can be used to
    facilitate knowledge acquisition through analogy mechanisms
    within a domain and across domains. Our sample knowledge
    acquisition dialogues with a domain expert illustrate which
    parts of the process are addressed by the human and which parts
    are automated by the tool, in a synergistic cooperation for
    knowledge-base extension and refinement. The paper also
    describes briefly the Expect problem-solving architecture that
    facilitates this approach to knowledge acquisition.</abstract>

    <abstract>This document is the result of a joint effort to
    understand what are relevant factors to consider when there are
    several possible courses of action (COAs) to accomplish a
    Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) military mission.
    These relevant factors are useful for generation and evaluation
    of COAs and provide the basis for a good decision in selecting
    a COA. The document compiles the relevant factors from the
    perspective of logistics that are useful to evaluate whether or
    not alternative proposed COAs can be supported logistically,
    and which ones seem to be better alternatives compared to the
    others. The ultimate goal of this joint effort is to use these
    factors to automate the evaluation and comparison of COAs and
    use the comparison to determine what are critical aspects of a
    COA that may be changed to produce a better option with a
    generative planner. We discuss how we envision using Expect and
    O-Plan2 for this purpose.</abstract>

    <abstract>Building a knowledge base requires iterative
    refinement to correct imperfections that keep lurking after
    each new version of the system. This paper concentrates on the
    automatic refinement of incomplete domain models for planning
    systems, presenting both a methodology for addressing the
    problem and empirical results. Planning knowledge may be
    refined automatically through direct interaction with the
    environment. Missing conditions cause unreliable predictions of
    action outcomes. Missing effects cause unreliable predictions
    of facts about the state. We present a practical approach based
    on continuous and selective interaction with the environment
    that pinpoints the type of fault in the domain knowledge that
    causes any unexpected behavior of the environment, and resorts
    to experimentation when additional information is needed to
    correct the fault. Our approach has been implemented in EXPO, a
    system that uses PRODIGY as a baseline planner and improves its
    domain knowledge in several domains when initial domain
    knowledge is up to 50% incomplete. The empirical results
    presented show that EXPO dramatically improves its prediction
    accuracy and reduces the amount of unreliable action
    outcomes.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper addresses a computational approach to the
    automated acquisition of domain knowledge for planning systems
    via experimentation with the environment. Our previous work has
    shown how existing incomplete operators can be refined by
    adding missing preconditions and effects. Here we develop
    additional methods to acquire new operators such as direct
    analogy with existing operators, decomposition of monolithic
    operators into meaningful sub-operators, and experimentation
    with partially-specified operators.</abstract>

    <abstract>Planning systems often make the assumption that
    omniscient world knowledge is available. Our approach makes the
    more realistic assumption that the initial knowledge about the
    actions is incomplete, and uses experimentation as a learning
    mechanism when the missing knowledge causes an execution
    failure. Previous work on learning by experimentation has not
    addressed the issue of how to choose good experiments, and much
    research on learning from failure has relied on background
    knowledge to build explanations that pinpoint directly the
    causes of failures. We want to investigate the potential of a
    system for efficient learning by experimentation without such
    background knowledge. This paper describes domain-independent
    heuristics that compare possible hypotheses and choose the ones
    most likely to cause the failure. These heuristics extract
    information solely from the domain operators initially
    available for planning (incapable of producing such
    explanations) and the planner's experiences in interacting with
    the environment. Our approach has been implemented in EXPO, a
    system that uses PRODIGY as a baseline planner and improves its
    domain knowledge in several domains. The empirical results
    presented show that EXPO's heuristics dramatically reduce the
    number of experiments needed to refine incomplete
    operators.</abstract>

    <abstract>In order for autonomous systems to interact with
    their environment in an intelligent way, they must be given the
    ability to adapt and learn incrementally and deliberately. It
    is virtually impossible to devise and hand code all potentially
    relevant domain knowledge for complex dynamic tasks. This
    thesis describes a framework to acquire domain knowledge for
    planning by failure-driven experimentation with the
    environment. The initial domain knowledge in the system is an
    approximate model for planning in the environment, defining the
    system's expectations. The framework exploits the
    characteristics of planning domains in order to search the
    space of plausible hypotheses without the need for additional
    background knowledge to build causal explanations for
    expectation failures. Plans are executed while the external
    environment is monitored, and differences between the internal
    state and external observations are detected by various methods
    each correlated with a typical cause for the expectation
    failure. The methods also construct a set of concrete
    hypotheses to repair the knowledge deficit. After being
    heuristically filtered, each hypothesis is tested in turn with
    an experiment. After the experiment is designed, a plan is
    constructed to achieve the situation required to carry out the
    experiment. The experiment plan must meet constraints such as
    minimizing plan length and negative interference with the main
    goals. The thesis describes a set of domain-independent
    constraints for experiments and their incorporation in the
    planning search space. After the execution of the plan and the
    experiment, observations are collected to conclude if the
    experiment was successful or not. Upon success, the hypothesis
    is confirmed and the domain knowledge is adjusted. Upon
    failure, the experimentation process is iterated on the
    remaining hypotheses until success or until no more hypotheses
    are left to be considered. This framework has shown to be an
    effective way to address incomplete planning knowledge and is
    demonstrated in a system called EXPO, implemented on the
    PRODIGY planning architecture. The effectiveness and efficiency
    of EXPO's methods is empirically demonstrated in several
    domains, including a large-scale process planning task, where
    the planner can recover from situations missing up to 50% of
    domain knowledge through repeated experimentation.</abstract>

    <abstract>Autonomous systems require the ability to plan
    effective courses of action under potentially uncertain or
    unpredictable contingencies. Planning requires knowledge of the
    environment that is accurate enough to allow reasoning about
    actions. If the environment is too complex or very dynamic,
    goal-driven learning with reactive feedback becomes a
    necessity. This chapter addresses the issue of learning by
    experimentation as an integral component of PRODIGY. PRODIGY is
    a flexible planning system that encodes its domain knowledge as
    declarative operators, and applies the operator refinement
    method to acquire additional preconditions or postconditions
    when observed consequences diverge from internal expectations.
    When multiple explanations for the observed divergence are
    consistent with the existing domain knowledge, experiments to
    discriminate among these explanations are generated. The
    experimentation process isolates the deficient operator and
    inserts the discriminant condition or unforeseen side-effect to
    avoid similar impasses in future planning. Thus,
    experimentation is demand-driven and exploits both the internal
    state of the planner and any external feedback received. A
    detailed example of integrated experiment formulation in
    presented as the basis for a systematic approach to extending
    an incomplete domain theory or correcting a potentially
    inaccurate one.</abstract>
