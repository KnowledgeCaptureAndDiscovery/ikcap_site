<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1">A Screen Walkthrough
Demonstration of <b>Trellis</b></font></b>
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Version 1.0, August 2001</font></b></center>

<p /><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Brief Overview</font></i></b>
<p /><b>Trellis</b> is an interactive environment that will allow users to add their
observations, viewpoints, and conclusions as they analyze information by
making semantic annotations to documents and other on-line resources. We
view this as a knowledge acquisition problem, where users are adding new
knowledge to the system based on their expertise as they analyze information.
<p /><b>Trellis</b> can be accessed from the main project page at <a href="http://trellis.semanticweb.org">http://trellis.semanticweb.org</a>,
or from <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/trellis">http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/trellis</a>.
<p />Each analysis that the user performs has a purpose that is used to describe
the issue analyzed. <b>Trellis</b> asks the user to specify a purpose, which
is a short sentence that summarizes the issue or hypothesis in question.
<p />Each piece of information or data that is used in the analysis is called
a statement. A statement can be linked to a Web resource, it could
be a manual or authoritative source. <b>Trellis</b> allows the user to access
a Web search engine and use the results of the search to create new statements.
Users can also enter statements that are not Web pages but instead have
text such as an email message, or a note about a conversation, or any other
text. The user can specify a URL but it is not necessary. In
addition to input information and data, the user can add statements that
indicate intermediate conclusions or hypothesis. Statements can also
be used to indicate the sources of some information. Sources can
be qualified according to the user's view on their reliability and credibility.
The user can define new statements or modify existing ones at any time.
<p />The overall analysis is composed of units, which are composed in turn
of sub-units. Each unit relates individual statements using a construct
from the <b>Trellis</b> vocabulary. All the statements within a unit are linked
to some Web source or user-provided text. Users can provide reasons
("because") or not, depending on the amount of detail that they wish to
capture in each part of the analysis. Only some portions of a given
unit are part of the <b>Trellis</b> language. The rest of the components
of the unit (i.e., the statements) are treated as strings and <b>Trellis</b> will
not process them further.
At any time, users can compose their analysis from the statements that
they have selected and created. The analysis of a purpose is made
of units, which may have sub-units in turn. Users can collapse or
expand any portions of the analysis and manipulate units and sub-units
to refine their interdependencies. Users can also rearrange the units in
the analysis by dragging and dropping them in the analysis window.
This is useful in cases where the analysis is done bottom-up and the users
wants to relate units that were created previously separately.
<p />Sometimes a user does not know yet how to use a statement in an analysis
but would like to have that statement included in the analysis frame.
Users can select statements and include them in the analysis under a 'Notes
and other information' category. This facility is also useful to
drag and drop statements into the analysis.
<p />Users can also import statements and units from other users if they
are relevant to your purpose. The user can do keyword search in either
purpose names or statement titles entered by other users.
<p /><b>Trellis</b> can be used offline if you cache Web pages before disconnecting
from the network. Statements can be selected and a cached copy of their
corresponding Web pages is created and used until otherwise indicated.
<p />Users can view the results of their analysis annotated in several markup
languages: XML, RDF, and DAML, corresponding to the Schemas and ontologies
that define the <b>Trellis</b> vocabulary.

<p /><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Screen Walkthrough of an Example</font></i></b>
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">Start with the Login Screen.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageRD5.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">Each analysis that the
user performs has a "purpose" that is used to describe the issue analyzed.<br />
After logging in, you are presented with the purposes which you have (or
a person with your login ID has) made so far. By default, there are 3 purposes
which are added for each new user.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageRP6.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">You can make a new purpose
by the "New Purpose" button, which prompts for the name of the new purpose</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageQJJ.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">After creating a new purpose
OR when editing an existing purpose, you end up with the <i><u>purpose
editor window </u></i>as shown below. The left side of the screen is used
to find, select, and edit the statements used in analyzing the purpose.<br />
The right side of the screen is used to construct and view the details
of the analysis.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b>
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">A <i><u>query frame</u></i>
is in the top left hand side, in which you can fire off queries to a search
engine (in this version of <b>Trellis</b> the search engine is Google), and get
the results in the <i><u>results frame</u></i> below.</font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">There is nothing in the
current selections here, since this is a new purpose. Nor is there anything
in the <i><u>statements frame</u></i>, which is the frame shown in the
lower left of the screen</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/image7GI.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">The results from the search
engine that you find relevant can be selected by clicking their icon and
clicking on 'Add Selections'.<br /> The Web pages selected are added to
the statements frame at the bottom left.</font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b><br />
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageCPO.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">The selected pages can
be renamed to reflect the salient fact that they contain that needs to
be brought up in the analysis of the overall purpose.<br /> You can rename
something by selecting it and pressing Ren (one of the buttons for editing
of current selections).<br /> A selected page can also be deleted (selecting
it and then clicking on the Delete button).<br /> Anything in the statements
frame can also be moved to the analysis frame on the right hand side to
start building the analysis (by selecting it and clicking the "Move ->"
button).</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageGEQ.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">Not all statements come
from Web pages.<br /> You can also add new statements manually, for example
an email message, or a note about a conversation, or any other text.<br />
This is done by clicking on "Add user data".<br /> You can specify a URL
if you wish, but it is not necessary.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b>
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">Any new statements entered
manually also have to be selected in order to be added to the statements
frame and ultimately to the analysis.</font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b><br />
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageTGQ.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">Some statements denote
a source (e.g., CNN) that you want to cite in your analysis.<br /> You
can describe a source in detail using the 'Desc' button as shown. This
description will be shown whenever you click on this source statement.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageF1O.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">You can also view user-entered
statements by clicking on them.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/image3MG.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">To modify a user-entered
statement, select it and click on the Edit button, then enter the new information.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageFTV.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">At any time, you can compose
your analysis from the statements that you have selected and created.<br />
The analysis of a purpose is made of units, which may have sub-units in
turn.<br /> Click the "Add Unit" button, where you can select statements
and constructs from the <b>Trellis</b> language in order to create an expression.<br />
You can also annotate the source of the analysis and qualify the source
for its reliability and credibility.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b>
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">You can build a unit using
the default <b>Trellis</b> constructs, but you can also define your own by selecting
"New".</font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b><br />
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageQLE.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">Units are normally shown
as a collapsible list that the user can select and expand. If any sub-units
are added after selecting a statement, they will be added under this statement
in the collapsible tree.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageOEU.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">You can also use statements
and units from other users if they are relevant to your purpose.<br />
To do this, click on the "Import" button and you will be prompted for a
keyword to search (here 'Iraq') in either Purpose names or Statement titles
entered by other users.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageKD4.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">From the results obtained,
you can select a purpose.<br /> The system will show an uneditable version
of the analysis frame. You can select any unit and import it.<br /> Notice
that if you select the top unit the entire analysis is imported.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageVV3.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">After importing, the selected
units and sub-units (along with the statements used in them) as well as
the sources are added to your own set.</font></b>
<p /><img src="demoimages/image270.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">You can also rearrange
the units in the analysis by dragging and dropping them in the analysis
frame.<br /> This is useful if you do your analysis bottom-up and want
to relate units that you created previously separately.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b>
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">To move a unit, select
it first by moving the mouse to the left side of the triangle widget and
clicking on it.<br /> Hold down the mouse and move it to the place
where you want the unit to be.<br /> A black line shows the position where
the unit would be dropped.<br /> A transparent box shows its future parent
unit. (So you can either drag to, or into).</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b>
<p /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1">There are 2 modes of dragging
: Left-click and drag drags the whole tree (as shown), and right click
and drag just drags the particular unit.</font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"></font></b><br />
<p /><img src="demoimages/imageCE4.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
