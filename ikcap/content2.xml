    Our research focus is the development of acquisition
    interfaces that help users to extend the knowledge of intelligent systems
    and their knowledge bases.  
    Much of our work has been on <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">planning</a>
    tasks and applications, including process models.  
    A recent area is <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">grounding knowledge bases
    in the Semantic Web</a>.

    Our research focus is the development of acquisition
    interfaces that help users to extend the knowledge of intelligent systems
    and their knowledge bases.  You may be familiar with our 
    <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/">EXPECT</a> knowledge acquisition tools.
    
    Our work concentrates on several research themes:
    <ul>
    <li> When users are not AI experts, what kinds of help do they need to 
    teach new knowledge to an intelligent system?
    We have conducted a number of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">user studies</a>
    and some of the central problems we found are:
       <ul> 
            <li> <b>How can we help users handle the formal representations that our systems use?</b>
            Building on past research on natural language generation, we have developed an
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">English-based editor</a> that allows
            users to select meaningful strings of a paraphrase and search the knowledge
            base for sensible alternative replacements.
            <li> How do users know they are doing the right thing?  
            When a system understands how each individual piece of knowledge relates to others
            then it can figure out how new knowledge fits, and can figure out how to interact
            with the user when new knowledge is inconsistent or when other necessary knowledge 
            is missing.  Our approach is to build acquisition interfaces that can
            automatically derive Interdependency Models from a knowledge base and use them to 
            guide the acquisition dialogue.  
            We used this approach in
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">EXPECT</a>,
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">EMeD (EXPECT's Method Editor)</a>,
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KANAL</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KAMM</a>.
            <li> <b>How can we help users make complex modifications to a knowledge 
            base that require many related small changes?</b>
            We have developed dialogue planning tools that represent
            typical sequences of changes that users make and use them to
            dynamically generate follow-up questions to users.  
            We used this approach in
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KA Scripts</a>,
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">PSMTool/Constable</a>, and
            our new work on
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KASPER</a>.
            
            <li> <b>How can we help users figure out where to start?</b>
            Because it is hard for users to start entering knowledge
            from scratch, we assume that the system has some 
            general background knowledge that the user populates 
            with domain-specific information.
            We have built several declarative domain theories for this
            purpose, including
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">PLANET (a PLAn semantic NET)</a> and
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">evaluation</a>.
            
            <li> <b>How can a user turn informal and possibly disconnected information
            into increasingly more formalized and operational knowledge?</b>
            
           </ul>
    
    <li> Our research is motivated by real applications, which often 
    revolve around planning and process models:
    <ul>
    <li> knowledge acquisition for planning:
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">PSMTool/Constable</a>,

            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">Pathway Assembly</a>            
    <li> plan evaluation and user preferences: 
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">evaluation</a>    
    <li> plan representation and ontologies:
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">goal representations</a>
