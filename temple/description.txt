<h2>Description</h2> 

<p> The Active Templates program (AcT) is developing a robust,
lightweight software technology for aiding in the automation of detailed
planning and execution for military operations and other
highly-coordinated activities using a plan spreadsheet metaphor. Active
Templates are distributed data structures whose variables can be linked
to live data feeds or problem-solving methods. Active Templates assist
with automated planning and execution by capturing, improving and
updating critical information such as current state, goals, constraints,
alternative actions, standard defaults, problem-solving context over
time, decisions, and rationale. Active Templates are designed to be
user-tailorable, networked, noise-tolerant, user-supported, scalable and
widely adopted.  </p>

<p>Within AcT, the <b>TEMPLE</b> project is developing software tools to
aid a user in adding new constraints to active templates. This work
makes use of prior work on problem-solving methods and script-based
acquisition for plan evaluation performed under HPKB and ARPI.
