Recent advances in geophysics have made it possible for the first time
to create fully three-dimensional simulations of fault-rupture and
fault-system dynamics.   Such physics-based simulations are crucial to
gaining a fundamental understanding of 
earthquake phenomena, and they
can potentially provide enormous practical benefits for assessing and
mitigating earthquake risks through improvements in seismic hazard
analysis.  This project
represents a collaboration among the

Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC)</a>, the 
<a href="http://www.isi.edu">
Information Sciences Institute (ISI)</a>, the

To achieve its objectives, the environment must provide a means for
describing, configuring, instantiating, and executing complex
computational pathways that result from the composition of various
earthquake simulation models.  This entails solving a number of
challenging problems in information technology. Many object types must
be manipulated, and a number of algorithms must be employed.  Algorithm
inputs and outputs can be very complex and take different meanings for
users in different disciplines.  Models are developed in distributed
collaborations, and any model component may require access to remote
databases and data sets, as well as require remote high-performance
computing resources for its execution.  To solve these problems, we will
bring together research from several distinct computer science
disciplines:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Knowledge representation and reasoning</b> techniques to manage the
heterogeneity of the models and capture the complex relationships
between the physical processes and the model algorithms, between the
algorithms and the simulation codes, and between the simulation codes
and the data products.  Knowledge-based inference will be used to apply
these representations to the problems of pathway construction,
constraint checking, execution planning, and information access. </li>

<li> <b>Grid technologies</b> to enable access to distributed simulation codes
and resources for the timely execution of the simulation scenarios
defined by users, specifically by integrating high-performance computing
resources into the execution environment available to the modeling
framework.  By providing mechanisms for the discovery, access, and
management of distributed computation and storage resources, Grids
address the distributed nature of the developers, resources and user
environments. </li>

<li><b>Digital library</b> technology to manage the collections of data and
simulation code repositories and handle multiple versions of the models.
 Knowledge-based data management tools will provide an infrastructure
for mediating access to existing seismic data catalogs and information
repositories, as well as incorporating new collections of data generated
by the simulations. </li>

<li><b>Interactive knowledge acquisition</b> techniques to enable users with a
range of sophistication to configure computational pathways.  Knowledge
acquisition tools support this activity by selecting appropriate
simulation software and input data files from the available code and
information repositories.  These tools hide implementation details and
present users with structured dialogues that guide them to provide
information required to set up each simulation while resolving the
constraints among the simulation models and their inputs. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The proposed research will be conducted
by a collaboration between leading researchers in each of these
information technology areas and earthquake scientists.
