 <u>Objective</u>: We are developing intelligent reasoners and interfaces that
enable users to 1) publish implemented codes of earthquake simulation models
and describe model constraints 2) access published simulation models and check
constraint violations, and 3) interactively construct computational
pathways. We are developing a novel approach to interactive pathway
composition that uses knowledge bases to represent and reason about model
constraints and planning approaches to reason about the relationships among
components within an end-to-end pathway computation.  We are also
investigating how to model the grid execution environment so that the user can
be isolated from the details of the execution of the pathway.  
<p>
<u>Systems
Developed</u>: <ul>

<li><A href="../cat">CAT</A> (Composition
Analysis Tool): CAT facilitates interactive construction of computational
pathways where users select and connect existing SCEC components, and the
system generates assistance in completing a correctly formulated
pathway. Given a sketch of a pathway, CAT analyzes it using the semantic
description of components, reports errors and gaps, and generates specific
suggestions on how to fix these errors. When a pathway is completed, it forms
an end-to-end simulation for earthquake scientists.  


<li><A href="../docker">DOCKER</A>
(Distributed Operations of Code with
Knowledge-based descriptions for Earthquake Research): DOCKER is a tool that
enables model developers to publish the code for their models, describe I/O
parameter types in terms of SCEC ontologies, and specify and document
constraints of model use. DOCKER helps end users access models from a uniform
interface, invoke models correctly by enforcing constraints, and find
appropriate simulation models for their requirements.

<li>Artemis : We have done some preliminary work in using query planning
techniques to access metadata catalogs in the grid. Artemis isolates the users
from the complexity of using distributed heterogeneous catalogs by providing
interactive assistance to formulate valid, integrated queries using a single
ontology that is automatically mapped to the particular metadata of each
catalog.  

</ul>
<p>
<u>CAT Integration with SCEC/IT infrastructure</u>: In Spring 2004, we
participated in a successful end-to-end demo of CAT integrated with the SCEC
grid workflow execution system.  The following shows a SCEC user interface with the
results of the execution in the SCEC grid environment of a pathway created
with CAT.  The left-hand side is a rendering of the knowledge base that
represents all the components and abstract component types that the user can
include in the pathway.  This is based on our Year 1 work on the DOCKER
system.

<u>Recent Work</u>: We are developing CAT-S, a service-based architecture
based on CAT that can also be used to check the correctness of a workflow but
that can be invoked programmatically from other applications and user
interface modalities.  Given a specification of a workflow, CAT-S analyzes it
using the semantic descriptions of components, reports errors and gaps, and
generates specific suggestions on how to fix these errors.  CAT-S can be
reinvoked with a selection of suggestions, and will fix the workflow
accordingly.  The interaction can thus proceed stepwise, with each analyze
followed by an apply fix call, until the pathway is completed.  Our plan is to
integrate CAT-S with the Pegasus workflow planning and execution system that
has been recently adopted for SCEC.  <p>
