<p>
There has been increasing interest in service composition for
management of tasks and resources. Creating and managing workflows of
tasks on the web and on computational grids has simplified data
integration and business process integration. Now widely distributed
services can be discovered and composed into workflows either manually
or automatically, revolutionizing integration approaches to
distributed services.
</p>

<p>
Management of resources, including software and hardware that may be
located centrally or distributed across a network, has emerged as a
significant obstacle to reducing the cost of Information Technology
while increasing business productivity. Self-management of systems
for configuration, protection, recovery and optimization is promoted
as Autonomic Computing in industry. Here, workflows have been adopted 
as the underlying representation to connect inter-related tasks 
required for self-management.
</p>

<p>
AI planning and scheduling techniques will play an essential role in
managing workflows of task ranging from their generation, storage &
retrieval, analysis, composition, allocation of resources, execution
and repair. However, many issues remain to be resolved. These include
(1) determining how to bridge the gap between existing plan and
workflow languages, whether existing domain and workflow languages are
appropriate or whether new features or languages are needed, (2)
forming precise characterizations of service life cycle including
composition, execution and workflow management, (3) identifying the
most appropriate ways to formalize service discovery and composition
problems, (4) highlighting important challenges for planning and
scheduling systems to be maximally effective in these areas, and (5)
supporting operational robustness in 24/7 environment.

<p>
This workshop is the continuation of two successful workshops at ICAPS
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/info-agents/workshops/icaps2003-p4ws/">2003</a>
and <a href="http://www.isi.edu/ikcap/workshops/icaps04">2004</a> on
planning and scheduling for web and grid services and will explore
autonomic computing as well. It will bring together researchers who are
working on these topics and face these issues as well as real systems
that are under development. Those wishing to attend are encouraged to
submit either a long paper of up to 8 pages in AAAI format, or a short
position paper of up to 3 pages. Topics of interest include but are not
limited to:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Expressive description languages for services and workflows</li>
<li>Integrating business process modeling with planning and scheduling
  using workflows</li>
<li>Automatic and mixed-initiative composition of services,
  interoperability in workflow collaboration</li>
<li>Interleaving information gathering and workflow management</li>
<li>Distributed workflow management</li>
<li>Storage, analysis and retrieval of composed services</li>
<li>Execution monitoring and workflow repair</li>
<li>Plan verification and plan quality for services and workflows</li>
</ul>
