	 <abstract>
	  Incremental utility elicitation (IUE) is a decision-theoretic framework in which tools simultaneously make suggestions to a human decision maker based on an incomplete model of the decision maker's utility function, and update the model based on feedback from the user. Most systems that perform IUE construct and ask questions about a small number of alternatives in order to build a model of the user's preferences. We describe a system called VEIL that is based on visual exploration of the available alternatives and provides visual cues about their estimated utility based on IUE. VEIL uses a linear programming formulation to make fast updates to the utility estimate based on the user's expressed preferences between pairs of alternatives. In experiments, VEIL's update method converges quickly to make good suggestions and help the user form an overall impression of the space of alternatives.

      The operation of a human organization requires dozens of everyday tasks to ensure coherence in organizational activities, to monitor the status of such activities, to gather information relevant to the organization, to keep everyone in the organization informed, etc. Teams of software agents can aid humans in accomplishing these tasks, facilitating the organization's coherent functioning and rapid response to crises, while reducing the burden on humans. Based on this vision, this paper reports on Electric Elves, a system that has been operational, 24/7, at our research institute since June 1, 2000. Tied to individual user workstations, fax machines, voice, mobile devices such as cell phones and palm pilots, Electric Elves has assisted us in routine tasks, such as rescheduling meetings, selecting presenters for research meetings, tracking people's locations, organizing lunch meetings, etc. We discuss the underlying AI technologies that led to the success of Electric Elves, including technologies devoted to agent-human interactions, agent coordination, accessing multiple heterogeneous information sources, dynamic assignment of organizational tasks, and deriving information about organization members. We also report the results of deploying Electric Elves in our own research organization.

      The area of knowledge acquisition research concerned with the development of knowledge acquisition (KA) tools is in need of a methodological approach to evaluation. Efforts such as the Sisyphus experiments have been useful to illustrate particular approaches, but have not served in practice as testbeds for comparing and evaluating different alternative approaches. This paper describes our experimental methodology to conduct studies and experiments of users modifying knowledge bases with KA tools. We also report the lessons learned from several experiments that we have performed. Our hope is that it will help others design or improve future user evaluations of KA tools. We found that performing these experiments is particularly hard because of difficulties in controlling factors that are unrelated to the particular claims being tested. We discuss our ideas for improving our current methodology and some open issues that remain.

    This paper describes an integrated acquisition interface that includes several techniques previously developed to support users in various ways as they add new knowledge to an intelligent system. As a result of this integration, the individual techniques can take better advantage of the context in which they are invoked and provide stronger guidance to users. We describe the current implementation using examples from a travel planning domain, and demonstrate how users can add complex knowledge to the system.

	 <abstract>
	 Role-limiting approaches using explicit theories of problem-solving have been successful for acquiring knowledge from domain experts. However most systems using this approach do not support acquiring procedural knowledge, only instance and type information.  Approaches using interdependencies among different pieces of knowledge have been successful for acquiring procedural knowledge, but these approaches usually do not provide all the support that domain experts require. We show how the two approaches can be combined in such a way that each benefits from information provided by the other. We extend the role-limiting approach with a knowledge acquisition tool that dynamically generates questions for the user based on the problem solving method. This allows a more flexible interaction pattern. When users add knowledge, this tool generates expectations for the procedural knowledge that is to be added. When these procedures are refined, new expectations are created from interdependency models that in turn refine the information used by the system. The implemented KA tool provides broader support than previously implemented systems. Preliminary evaluations in a travel planning domain show that users who are not programmers can, with little training, specify executable procedural knowledge to customize an intelligent system.

      PHOSPHORUS is an agent matchmaking service that exploits domain ontologies, description logic, and a highly declarative language to reason about task-related agent capabilities. PHOSPHORUS uses the Expect goal language to represent the tasks that agents are capable of accomplishing, as well as requests to locate agents with a required capability. PHOSPHORUS supports matching through subsumption, reverse subsumption, and several kinds of goal reformulation.

      The Expect project has focused on acquiring problem-solving knowledge for users for the last decade, using an expressive language that is open to inspection. Our aim has been to alleviate the bottleneck in creating knowledge-based systems by providing support for both knowledge engineers and end users to specify problem-solving knowledge. In this paper we summarize selected areas of current research where we focus on end users, and highlight some of the research questions that arise from them. We also summarize some of the results from experiments with end users using our tools.

      <abstract>
      In order to support a wide range of planning-related activities, we argue that plan and action representations must move to a more expressive language for goals and capabilities than is found in most current systems. A structured representation for capabilities can make explicit a hierarchy of capabilities based on subsumption, resulting in benefits for reasoning, representing, and acquiring operators and plans. By making capabilities more easily understandable to humans, such a representation can also benefit mixed-initiative approaches. We present a structured representation of capabilities and a subsumption-based matcher for it. We then describe three existing systems that use this approach in different kinds of planning tasks and tools. We finish with a discussion of how plan generation systems can benefit from using this representation.

    As intelligent systems become larger and work in increasingly more complex and knowledge intensive environments, it becomes impractical to develop knowledge bases from scratch. A practical alternative is to develop knowledge bases out of reusable components, either ontologies or domain-independent problem solving methods. This paper describes a reusable knowledge base of general principles about plan evaluation and critiquing. It includes ontologies to represent plans and critiques, an ontology of evaluation criteria, and problem-solving knowledge about how to evaluate plans with respect to those criteria. Currently, the evaluation criteria analyze various aspects of the plan structure and its use of resources. We performed a study of three evaluation and critiquing task domains, and found that our framework covers approximately 75 percent of the critiquing criteria related to plan structure and resource use (and over 90 percent within the framework's declared scope). Our framework also enables a systematic approach to the development of plan evaluation tools by following the organization of the criteria in the method.

      Developing tools that allow non-programmers to enter knowledge has been an ongoing challenge for AI. In recent years researchers have investigated a variety of promising approaches to knowledge acquisition (KA), but they have often been driven by the needs of knowledge engineers rather than by end users. This paper reports on a series of experiments that we conducted in order to understand how far a particular KA tool that we are developing is from meeting the needs of end users, and to collect valuable feedback to motivate our future research. This KA tool, called EMeD, exploits Interdependency Models derived from a knowledge base in order to guide users in specifying problem-solving knowledge. One of the challenges of this work is to devise a methodology and experimental procedure for conducting user studies of knowledge acquisition tools. We describe how our experiments helped us address several questions and hypotheses regarding the acquisition of problem-solving knowledge from end users and the benefits of Interdependency Models, and discuss what we learned in terms of improving not only our KA tools but also about KA research.

    Ontologies are becoming a recognized vehicle for knowledge reuse, knowledge sharing, and modeling. This paper presents PLANET, an ontology for representing plans. To show that PLANET is a comprehensive ontology that can be reused to build new applications, we describe several specializations of it to represent plans in three different real-world domains that were made by adding minor extensions to PLANET's general definitions and classes. In past work, we have developed several plan evaluation systems in these domains, and have integrated them in several occasions with plan editors and plan generation systems. For each of these integrations, and often for each system in the integration, a new format for exchanging plans was devised. PLANET can represent all of the plans that we and others have used in these domains, providing a standard universal format for knowledge sharing that can be used as an interlingua in integrated planning applications. Finally, the paper discusses how we have used PLANET as a knowledge modelling tool to design representations for courses of action in a military domain, guiding us to make useful distinctions and modelling choices.

      This paper describes a series of experiments with a range of users to evaluate an intelligent interface for acquiring problem-solving knowledge to describe how to accomplish a task. The tool derives the interdependencies between different pieces of knowledge in the system and uses them to guide the user in completing the acquisition task. The paper describes results obtained when the tool was tested with a wide range of users, including end users. The studies show that our acquisition interface saves users an average of 32% of the time it takes to add new knowledge, and highlight some interesting differences across user groups. The paper also describes what are the areas that need to be addressed in future research in order to make these tools usable by end users.

      In this paper, we use the example of a successful mixed-initiative plan evaluation tool for the domain of air campaign planning to argue that the human-in-the-loop is an important feature of enterprise control systems. Our tool, called INSPECT, evaluates air campaign plans and alerts the user about inconsistencies and potential problems. A generalization of INSPECT called PSMTool is also capable of limited interaction with a subject matter expert to capture new critiques of plans. The paper describes our work on INSPECT and PSMTool, analyzes the key contributions of these tools, and draws some conclusions about the role of mixed-initiative tools in enterprise control systems.

      Knowledge Acquisition (KA) Scripts capture typical modification sequences that users follow when they modify knowledge bases. KA tools can use these Scripts to guide users in making these modifications, ensuring that they follow all the ramifications of the change until it is completed. This paper describes our approach to design, develop, and organize a library of KA Scripts. We report the results of three different analysis to develop this library, including a detailed study of actual modification scenarios in two knowledge bases. In addition to identifying a good number of KA Scripts, we found a set of useful attributes to describe and organize the KA Scripts. These attributes allow us to analyze the size of the library and generate new KA Scripts in a systematic way. We have implemented a portion of this library and conducted two different studies to evaluate it. The result of this evaluation showed a 15 to 52 percent time savings in modifying knowledge bases and that the library included relevant and useful KA Scripts to assist users in realistic settings.

      Configuration systems often use large and complex knowledge bases that need to be maintained and extended over time. The explicit representation of problem-solving knowledge and factual knowledge can greatly enhance the role of a knowledge acquisition tool by deriving from the current knowledge base, the knowledge gaps that must be resolved. This paper details Expect's approach to knowledge acquisition in the configuration domain using the propose-and-revise strategy as an example. Expect supports users in a variety of KA tasks like filling knowledge roles, making modifications to the knowledge base including entering new components, classes and even adapting problem-solving strategies for new tasks. Expect's guidance changes as the knowledge base changes, providing a more flexible approach to knowledge acquisition. The paper also examines the possible use of Expect as a KA tool in the complex and real world domain of computer configuration.

      <abstract>
      Successful approaches to developing knowledge acquisition tools use expectations of what the user has to add or may want to add, based on how new knowledge fits within a knowledge base that already exists. When a knowledge base is first created or undergoes significant extensions and changes, these tools cannot provide much support. This paper presents an approach to creating expectations when a new knowledge base is built, and describes a knowledge acquisition tool that we implemented using this approach that supports users in creating problem-solving knowledge. As the knowledge base grows, the knowledge acquisition tool derives more frequent and more reliable expectations that result from enforcing constraints in the knowledge representation system, looking for missing pieces of knowledge in the knowledge base, and working out incrementally the inter-dependencies among the different components of the knowledge base. Our preliminary evaluations show a thirty percent time savings during knowledge acquisition. Moreover, by providing tools to support the initial phases of knowledge base development, many mistakes are detected early on and even avoided altogether. We believe that our approach contributes to improving the quality of the knowledge acquisition process and of the resulting knowledge-based systems as well.

      We describe an editor for problem-solving knowledge that communicates with the user through English paraphrases of the knowledge. Although it does not support the full range of modifications one might want to make, the value of the tool lies in the fact that the user need not understand the syntax of the expert system to make modifications. By analyzing the problem-solving knowledge, the tool can allow the user to select semantically coherent chunks of the knowledge. It then presents English paraphrases of possible substitutions that would result in new problem-solving knowledge that is syntactically correct. In this way the tool expands the range of modifications that a naive user can make to problem-solving knowledge in an expert system.

      The area of knowledge acquisition research concerned with the development of knowledge acquisition (KA) tools is in need of a methodological approach to evaluation. Efforts such as the Sisyphus experiments have been useful to illustrate particular approaches, but have not served in practice as testbeds for comparing and evaluating different alternative approaches. This paper describes our experimental methodology to conduct studies and experiments of users modifying knowledge bases with KA tools. We also report the lessons learned from several experiments that we have performed. Our hope is that it will help others design or improve future user evaluations of KA tools. We found that performing these experiments is particularly hard because of difficulties in controlling factors that are unrelated to the particular claims being tested. We discuss our ideas for improving our current methodology and some open issues that remain.

      The recent advances in computer speed and algorithms for probabilistic inference have led to a resurgence of work on planning under uncertainty. The aim is to design AI planners for environments where there may be incomplete or faulty information, where actions may not always have the same results and where there may be tradeoffs between the different possible outcomes of a plan. Addressing uncertainty in AI planning algorithms will greatly increase the range of potential applications but there is plenty of work to be done before we see practical decision-theoretic planning systems. This article outlines some of the challenges that need to be overcome and surveys some of the recent work in the area.

      Modifying knowledge-based systems (KBSs) is a complex activity. One of its difficulties is that several related portions of the KBS might have to be changed in order to maintain the coherence of the system. However, it is difficult for users to figure out what has to be changed and how. This paper presents a novel approach for building knowledge acquisition (KA) tools that overcomes some of the limitations of current approaches. In this approach, knowledge of prototypical procedures for modifying KBSs is used to guide users in changing all related portions of a KBS. These procedures, which we call knowledge acquisition scripts (or KA Scripts), capture how related portions of a KBS can be changed coordinately. By using KA scripts, a KA tool would be able to relate individual changes in different parts of a KBS, enabling the analysis of each individual change from the perspective of the overall modification. The paper also describes the implementation of ETM: a script-based tool that builds on the Expect framework for building KBSs (Gil, 1994), discusses how we have addressed some important issues of this approach, and describes a preliminary empirical evaluation of ETM that shows that KA Scripts allow users to perform KBSs modification tasks more efficiently.

This paper describes an approach to building knowledge acquisition tools which capture knowledge about commonly occurring modification sequences and support users in completing the modifications they start. These sequences, which we call KA Scripts, relate individual changes and the effects that they have on the knowledge base. We discuss our experience in designing and compiling a library of KA Scripts. We also describe the implementation of a tool that uses them and our preliminary evaluations that demonstrate their usability.

      INSPECT is a mixed-initiative plan evaluation tool in the domain of air campaign planning that has been a central component of several major DARPA demonstrations of integrated planning environments and tools. The creation process of an air campaign plan is manually driven at its higher levels, and because plans are complex and always changing they often (our experience says always) contain errors or inconsistencies. INSPECT evaluates user-generated plans and alerts the user about inconsistencies and potential problems. INSPECT has received wide acceptance by air campaign planning experts, and is currently undergoing new extensions and further integrations with other tools in this domain. The paper describes our work on INSPECT, analyzes the key contributions of this tool, and draws some conclusions about the design and integration of planning applications.

      If we could share knowledge across systems, costs would be reduced. However, because knowledge bases are typically constructed from scratch, each with their own idiosyncratic structure, sharing is difficult. Recent research has focused on the use of ontologies to promote sharing. An ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a domain that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base. If two knowledge bases are built on a common ontology, knowledge can be more readily shared, since they share a common underlying structure. This paper outlines a set of desiderata for ontologies, and then describes how we have used a large-scale (50,000+ concept) ontology to develop a specialized, domain-specific ontology semi-automatically. We then discuss the relation between ontologies and the process of developing a system, arguing that to be useful, an ontology needs to be created as a "living document", whose development is tightly integrated with the system's. We conclude with a discussion of Web-based ontology tools we are developing to support this approach.

      Weaver is a hybrid planning algorithm that can create plans in domains that include uncertainty, modelled either as incomplete knowledge of the initial state of the world, of the effects of plan steps or of the possible external events. The plans are guaranteed to exceed some given threshold probability of success. Weaver creates a Bayesian network representation of a plan to evaluate it, in which links corresponding to sequences of events are computed with Markov models. As well as the probability of success, evaluation produces a set of flaws in the candidate plan, which are used by the planner to improve it. We describe a learning method that generates control knowledge compiled from this probabilistic evaluation of plans. The output of the learner is search control knowledge for the planning domain that helps the planner select alternatives that have previously lead to plans with high probability of success. The learned control knowledge is incrementally refined by a combined deductive and inductive mechanism.

      <abstract>
      Role-limiting approaches support knowledge acquisition (KA) by centering knowledge base construction on common types of tasks or domain-independent problem-solving strategies. Within a particular problem-solving strategy, domain-dependent knowledge plays specific roles. A KA tool then helps a user to fill these roles. Although role-limiting approaches are useful for guiding KA, they are limited because they only support users in filling knowledge roles that have been built in by the designers of the KA system. Expect takes a different approach to KA by representing problem-solving knowledge explicitly, and deriving from the current knowledge base the knowledge gaps that must be resolved by the user during KA. This paper contrasts role-limiting approaches and Expect's approach, using the propose-and-revise strategy as an example. Expect not only supports users in filling knowledge roles, but also provides support in 1) adapting the problem-solving strategy, 2) changing the types of information to be acquired about a knowledge role, 3) adding new knowledge roles, and 4) acquiring additional background information about the domain needed by the knowledge-based system. Expect's guidance changes as the knowledge base changes, providing a more flexible approach to knowledge acquisition. This work provides evidence supporting the need for explicit representations in building knowledge-based systems.

      Expect provides an environment for developing knowledge-based systems that allows end-users to add new knowledge without needing to understand the details of system organization and implementation. The key to Expect's approach is that it understands the structure of the knowledge-based system being built: how it solves problems and what knowledge it needs to support problem-solving. Expect uses this information to guide users in maintaining the knowledge-based system. We have used Expect to develop a tool for evaluating transportation plans.

      A system that acquires knowledge from a user should be able to reflect upon the knowledge that it has - at each moment - and understand what kinds of new knowledge it needs to learn. For the past two decades, research in the area of knowledge acquisition has been moving towards systems that have access to richer representations of knowledge about their task. This paper reviews some well-known knowledge acquisition tools representative of this trend. It also describes our recent work in Expect, a system with explicit representations of knowledge about the task and the domain that supports knowledge acquisition for a wider range of tasks and applications than its predecessors. We hope our observations will be useful to researchers in user interfaces and in machine learning concerned with acquiring information from users.

      <abstract>
      Our goal is to build knowledge acquisition tools that support users in making a broad range of changes to a knowledge base, including both factual and problem-solving knowledge. These changes may require several individual modifications to various parts of the knowledge base, that need to be carefully coordinated to prevent users from introducing errors in the knowledge base. Thus, it becomes essential that our KA tools understand the consequences of each kind of change that the user may initiate, detect any harmful side-effects that can be introduced in the system, and guide the user in resolving them. To address this issue, we have developed a transaction-based approach to knowledge acquisition that can support users in making complex modifications to a knowledge base. A transaction is a sequence of changes that together modify some aspect of the behavior of a knowledge-based system, and that when only partially carried out may leave the knowledge base in an undesirable state. If a user executes a transaction partially, the knowledge acquisition tool must provide guidance to finish it and support the user in achieving the desired modification. This paper also describes our work in extending Expect's knowledge acquisition tool to support transaction-based mechanisms. Expect tracks the possible problems that arise as a consequence of each individual change to the knowledge base, keeps information about the context of each change, and uses this context to resolve the problems detected and to request the user's intervention if additional information is needed.

      To create more powerful knowledge acquisition systems, we not only need better acquisition tools, but we need to change the architecture of the knowledge based systems we create so that their structure will provide better support for acquisition. Current acquisition tools permit users to modify factual knowledge but they provide limited support for modifying problem solving knowledge. In this paper, we argue that this limitation (and others) stem from the use of incomplete models of problem solving knowledge and inflexible specification of the interdependencies between problem solving and factual knowledge. We describe the Expect architecture which addresses these problems by providing an explicit representation for problem solving knowledge and intent. Using this more explicit representation, Expect can automatically derive the interdependencies between problem solving and factual knowledge. By deriving these interdependencies from the structure of the system itself Expect supports more flexible and powerful knowledge acquisition.

      It is hard to evaluate in current planning applications what aspects of the approach address each of the complexities of the problem. This results from the fact that the planning community is lacking a vocabulary to describe planning tasks and applications. This work is an effort towards descriptions of planning applications in terms that are useful 1) to extract conclusions from particular implementations, 2) to facilitate cross-comparisons among different planners applied to the same problem, and 3) to facilitate comparisons among different tasks. We analyze the Sisyphus experience, a 3-year old and still ongoing effort in the knowledge acquisition community to enable a cross-comparison of their application systems as they implement a common pre-stated problem description. Based on this experience, we propose a set of dimensions to describe applications that distinghish between descriptions of the properties of the architecture, the type of problem, and the data sets. We show how they can be used to produce useful distictions in the context of the first Sisyphus task, which was an office assignment problem. Our hope is that the same dimensions will be useful to other researchers in describing and characterizing their applications, as well as a useful point of comparison for future Sisyphus efforts.

      <abstract>
      A knowledge acquisition tool should provide a user with maximum guidance in extending and debugging a knowledge base, by preventing inconsistencies and knowledge gaps that may arise inadvertently. Most current acquisition tools are not very flexible in that they are built for a predetermined inference structure or problem-solving mechanism, and the guidance they provide is specific to that inference structure and hard-coded by their designer. This paper focuses on Expect, a reflective architecture that supports knowledge acquisition based on an explicit analysis of the structure of a knowledge-based system, rather than on a fixed set of acquisition guidelines. Expect's problem solver is tightly integrated with LOOM, a state-of-the-art knowledge representation system. Domain facts and goals are represented declaratively, and the problem solver keeps records of their functionality within the task domain. When the user corrects the system's knowledge, Expect tracks any possible implications of this change in the overall system and cooperates with the user to correct any potential problems that may arise. The key to the flexibility of this knowledge acquisition tool is that it adapts its guidance as the knowledge bases evolve in response to changes introduced by the user.

      Rapid prototyping and tool reusability have pushed knowledge acquisition research to investigate method-specific knowledge acquisition tools appropriate for predetermined problem-solving methods. We believe that method-dependent knowledge acquisition is not the only approach. The aim of our research is to develop powerful yet versatile machine learning mechanisms that can be incorporated into general-purpose but practical knowledge acquisition tools. This paper shows through examples the practical advantages of this approach. In particular, we illustrate how existing knowledge can be used to facilitate knowledge acquisition through analogy mechanisms within a domain and across domains. Our sample knowledge acquisition dialogues with a domain expert illustrate which parts of the process are addressed by the human and which parts are automated by the tool, in a synergistic cooperation for knowledge-base extension and refinement. The paper also describes briefly the Expect problem-solving architecture that facilitates this approach to knowledge acquisition.

      This document is the result of a joint effort to understand what are relevant factors to consider when there are several possible courses of action (COAs) to accomplish a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) military mission. These relevant factors are useful for generation and evaluation of COAs and provide the basis for a good decision in selecting a COA. The document compiles the relevant factors from the perspective of logistics that are useful to evaluate whether or not alternative proposed COAs can be supported logistically, and which ones seem to be better alternatives compared to the others. The ultimate goal of this joint effort is to use these factors to automate the evaluation and comparison of COAs and use the comparison to determine what are critical aspects of a COA that may be changed to produce a better option with a generative planner. We discuss how we envision using Expect and O-Plan2 for this purpose.

      Building a knowledge base requires iterative refinement to correct imperfections that keep lurking after each new version of the system. This paper concentrates on the automatic refinement of incomplete domain models for planning systems, presenting both a methodology for addressing the problem and empirical results. Planning knowledge may be refined automatically through direct interaction with the environment. Missing conditions cause unreliable predictions of action outcomes. Missing effects cause unreliable predictions of facts about the state. We present a practical approach based on continuous and selective interaction with the environment that pinpoints the type of fault in the domain knowledge that causes any unexpected behavior of the environment, and resorts to experimentation when additional information is needed to correct the fault. Our approach has been implemented in EXPO, a system that uses PRODIGY as a baseline planner and improves its domain knowledge in several domains when initial domain knowledge is up to 50% incomplete. The empirical results presented show that EXPO dramatically improves its prediction accuracy and reduces the amount of unreliable action outcomes.

      This paper addresses a computational approach to the automated acquisition of domain knowledge for planning systems via experimentation with the environment. Our previous work has shown how existing incomplete operators can be refined by adding missing preconditions and effects. Here we develop additional methods to acquire new operators such as direct analogy with existing operators, decomposition of monolithic operators into meaningful sub-operators, and experimentation with partially-specified operators.

      Planning systems often make the assumption that omniscient world knowledge is available. Our approach makes the more realistic assumption that the initial knowledge about the actions is incomplete, and uses experimentation as a learning mechanism when the missing knowledge causes an execution failure. Previous work on learning by experimentation has not addressed the issue of how to choose good experiments, and much research on learning from failure has relied on background knowledge to build explanations that pinpoint directly the causes of failures. We want to investigate the potential of a system for efficient learning by experimentation without such background knowledge. This paper describes domain-independent heuristics that compare possible hypotheses and choose the ones most likely to cause the failure. These heuristics extract information solely from the domain operators initially available for planning (incapable of producing such explanations) and the planner's experiences in interacting with the environment. Our approach has been implemented in EXPO, a system that uses PRODIGY as a baseline planner and improves its domain knowledge in several domains. The empirical results presented show that EXPO's heuristics dramatically reduce the number of experiments needed to refine incomplete operators.

      <abstract>
      In order for autonomous systems to interact with their environment in an intelligent way, they must be given the ability to adapt and learn incrementally and deliberately. It is virtually impossible to devise and hand code all potentially relevant domain knowledge for complex dynamic tasks. This thesis describes a framework to acquire domain knowledge for planning by failure-driven experimentation with the environment. The initial domain knowledge in the system is an approximate model for planning in the environment, defining the system's expectations. The framework exploits the characteristics of planning domains in order to search the space of plausible hypotheses without the need for additional background knowledge to build causal explanations for expectation failures. Plans are executed while the external environment is monitored, and differences between the internal state and external observations are detected by various methods each correlated with a typical cause for the expectation failure. The methods also construct a set of concrete hypotheses to repair the knowledge deficit. After being heuristically filtered, each hypothesis is tested in turn with an experiment. After the experiment is designed, a plan is constructed to achieve the situation required to carry out the experiment. The experiment plan must meet constraints such as minimizing plan length and negative interference with the main goals. The thesis describes a set of domain-independent constraints for experiments and their incorporation in the planning search space. After the execution of the plan and the experiment, observations are collected to conclude if the experiment was successful or not. Upon success, the hypothesis is confirmed and the domain knowledge is adjusted. Upon failure, the experimentation process is iterated on the remaining hypotheses until success or until no more hypotheses are left to be considered. This framework has shown to be an effective way to address incomplete planning knowledge and is demonstrated in a system called EXPO, implemented on the PRODIGY planning architecture. The effectiveness and efficiency of EXPO's methods is empirically demonstrated in several domains, including a large-scale process planning task, where the planner can recover from situations missing up to 50% of domain knowledge through repeated experimentation.

      Autonomous systems require the ability to plan effective courses of action under potentially uncertain or unpredictable contingencies. Planning requires knowledge of the environment that is accurate enough to allow reasoning about actions. If the environment is too complex or very dynamic, goal-driven learning with reactive feedback becomes a necessity. This chapter addresses the issue of learning by experimentation as an integral component of PRODIGY. PRODIGY is a flexible planning system that encodes its domain knowledge as declarative operators, and applies the operator refinement method to acquire additional preconditions or postconditions when observed consequences diverge from internal expectations. When multiple explanations for the observed divergence are consistent with the existing domain knowledge, experiments to discriminate among these explanations are generated. The experimentation process isolates the deficient operator and inserts the discriminant condition or unforeseen side-effect to avoid similar impasses in future planning. Thus, experimentation is demand-driven and exploits both the internal state of the planner and any external feedback received. A detailed example of integrated experiment formulation in presented as the basis for a systematic approach to extending an incomplete domain theory or correcting a potentially inaccurate one.
